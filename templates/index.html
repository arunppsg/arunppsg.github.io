    <p>
        I am Arun. My work can be described as a cross between the works of <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy</a>, <a href="https://gvanrossum.github.io/">Guido van Rossum</a> and <a href="https://tiangolo.com/">Sebastián Ramírez</a> as I work on building AI applications in Python.
        Currently, I am a machine learning software engineer at <a href="https://deepforestsci.com">Deep Forest Sciences</a> working on building a web based machine learning platform for drug discovery applications.
        I also contribute to <a href="https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem">DeepChem</a>, a scientific python library for applying deep learning in molecular data.<br><br>
        Before Deep Forest, I worked as a project assistant at RISE Lab, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras for about a year where my work focused on detecting malwares from network traffic using predictive algorithms.
        I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science from PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore in May 2021.
        I also volunteer at <a href="https://fossunited.org/">FOSSUnited</a>, a non-profit aimed at strengthening the open-source software ecosystem in India by organizing the monthly FOSSUnited meetups at Bangalore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am open to new opportunities and collaboration. Feel free to reach out to me for the same.
