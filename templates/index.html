    <p>
        I am Arun. I work on ML + Science space. At Deep Forest Science, I work as a machine
        learning engineer where I work on building machine learning pipelines for drug discovery.

        I contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem">DeepChem</a> project and help in project maintenance. The DeepChem library builds tool for applying ML to scientific applications.
        Before Deep Forest, I worked as a project assistant at RISE Lab, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras for about a year. My work here focused on detecting malwares from network traffic.
        I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science from PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore in May 2021.
        I like to read, swim and practice yoga during my spare time and I care about socio-economic development and language development.
