    <p>
        I am Arun. I work on ML + Science space. At Deep Forest Science, I work as a machine
        learning engineer where I work on building machine learning pipelines for drug discovery.
        I also work on backend development and devops.
        I also contribute to the open source project <a href="https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem">DeepChem</a> and help in project maintenance. The DeepChem library is a tool for applying ML in scientific applications. To this end, I work on adding support for new models, building new features etc.
        Before Deep Forest, I worked as a project assistant at RISE Lab, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras for about a year.
        At RISE Lab, my work focused on detecting malwares from network traffic.
        I graduated with a Masters degree in Data Science from PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore in May 2021.
        I like to read, swim and practice yoga during my spare time and I care about socio-economic development and language development.
