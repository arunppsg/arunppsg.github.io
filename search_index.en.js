Notes"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/an-uncertain-glory/":{"body":"A note: The first edition of the book was published in 2013 and second edition in July 2019.\nNotes\nThough economic growth in India has picked up over time, the pace of improvement of living conditions remains very slow.\nOne reflection of this is India's poor social indicators compared with China and its other south Asian neighbors like Bangladesh and Nepal which are much poorer than India in terms of per-capita GDP.\nThe lethargy in social policy in India is further exacerbated be the dearth of social statistics.\nFor instance, when the book was written in 2013, we were constrained to rely on the third National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3) carried out in 2005-6.\nIn Bangladesh, by contrast, the Demographic and Health Survey has happened at regular intervals of three years or so since 1990's.\nAt the time of writing (July 2019), very few reliable social indicators are available beyond 2016.\nWell-functioning public services in fields like health and education are critical for fostering participatory growth as well as in ensuring that growth leads to rapid improvements in people's living conditions.\nIndian states such as Kerala, Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have done reasonably well in this respect but the general state of public service in India remains absolutely dismal and the country's health and education system in particular are messed up.\nWhile the privileged are able to take refugee in private institutions, the rest are deprived of essential facilities that ought to be available as a matter of right.\nEven though India has significantly caught up with China in terms of GDP growth, its progress has been much slower than China's in indicators such as longevity, literacy, child nourishment and maternal mortality.\nIn South Asia itself, the much poorer economy of Bangladesh has caught up with and overtaken India in terms of many social indicators like life expectancy, immunization of children, infant mortality, child nourishment and girls schooling.\nTwenty years ago India has the second-best social indicators among six south Asian countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan), it now looks second worst (only ahead of Pakistan).\nMany of these social problems can be dealt with by institutional reforms but there is also a need for change in behavioral norms to eliminate the acceptability of corrupt practices.\nFor several decades after independence, Indian economy growth was quite slow - 3.5 percent annually.\nThis lasted from 1950's to 1970's.\nIn the 1980's, the growth rate increased to 5 percent annually.\nAnd followed by economic reforms of the early 1990s, the economy settled down to faster progress of more than 7 per cent annually.\nDespite this rapid growth in recent years, hundred of millions continue to lack essential requirements for satisfactory living, from nutritious food to health care, decent work conditions, and warm clothes in the winter.\nWhat went wrong with the First Five Year Plan and other early economic planning?\nThey failed more completely in terms of social infrastructure and tertiary industries than it did in the fields of primary and secondary production.\nIn the recent decades of rapid growth, the living standards of the middle class (the top 20 percent of the population) have improved well beyond what was expected.\nBut the story is more complex for many others like the rickshaw puller, domestic worker or brick-kiln laborer.\nAccording to National Sample Survey data, average per capita expenditure in rural area rose at the exceedingly low rate of 1 per cent per year between 1993-4 and 2009-10 and even in urban area, the average per capita expenditure grew at only 2 per cent during this period.\nThere has also been a major slowdown in the growth of real agricultural wages: from about 5 per cent per year in the 1980's to 2 per cent or so in the 1990s ad virtually 0 in early 2000s. It is only after 2006, when the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) came into force that growth of real agricultural wages picked up again.\nIn contrast with China, according to comparable international data from the International Labor Organization, real wages in manufacturing in China grew at 12 per cent per year or so in the first decade of this century compared with 2.5 per cent per year in India.\nThe good deal of growth in services has been concentrated in skill-intensive sector (such as software development, financial services) rather than more traditional labor-intensive sectors.\nThis has enabled the more educated section of the labour force to earn much higher wages.\nFor the bulk of the labour force marooned in agriculture and the informal sector (about 90 percent of India's total workforce), wages and productivity tend to remain very low.\nIt may be less glamorous to make simple pocket knives and reliable alarm clocks than to design computer programs but the former gives the Chinese poor a source of income that the latter does not provide.\nTwo major problems face the Indian economy:\n\nremoving the sharp disparities that divide the country into the privileged and the rest while continuing to encourage economic growth.\nbringing more accountability to the running of the economy, particularly in delivery of public services and operation of public sector.\n\nIf development is about enhancing human freedoms and quality of life, then the quality of environment is bound to be part of what we want to preserve and promote.\nCaring about environment need not undermine the commitment to development and the removal of poverty and deprivation.\nThe crucial ingredients of our quality of life are thoroughly dependent on the integrity of the environment involving the air we breathe, water we drink and epidemiological surroundings in which we live.\nThe minority of people who has been prospering well enough in India is large in absolute numbers, though estimates of the size of this minority vary - they certainly for exceed 100 million or so.\nYet in the statistics involving more than 1.2 billion people, the fortunate group is still too small to swing the average figures for Indian population as a whole in terms of most social indicators.\nIndia's per capita income is 60 per center higher than Bangladesh in 1990 and in 2011, it was estimated to be double that of Bangladesh in 2011.\nBut during the same period, Bangladesh overtook India in a wide range of social indicators like life expectancy, child survival, enhanced immunization, reduced fertility rates and some schooling indicators.\nIndicatorIndia 1990Bangladesh 1990India 2011Bangladesh 2011\nGDP per capita PPP119374132031569\nLife expectancy at birth (in years)58596569\nInfant mortality rate (per 1000 live births)81974737\nUnder-5 mortality rate1141396146\nMaternal mortality ratio600800200240\nTotal fertility rate3.94.52.62.2\nInfant immunization (DPT) %59647296\nInfant immunization (measles) %47627496\nFemale literacy rate49387478\n\nOne of the important factor in Bangladesh's development is women's agency.\nFor instance, both female literacy rate and women's participation in workforce played an important role in demographic transition (from high to low mortality and decrease in fertility rates).\nWomen's participation in the workforce in is almost as twice as high in Bangladesh than in India (57 percent and 29 per cent respectively).\nGender indicator in India and Bangladesh:\nIndicatorIndiaBangladesh\nFemale labour participation rate, age 15 +2957\nFemale-male ratio in population, 2011940997\nRatio of female to male primary school enrollment, 2010 %100104\nRatio of female to male secondary school enrollment, 2010 %92113\nliteracy rate age 15-24 years, 2010 (%) female7478\nliteracy rate age 15-24 years, 2010 (%) male8875\n\nOther social indicators comparison between India and Bangladesh:\nIndicatorIndia (2005-06)Bangladesh (2007)\nProportion of household practicing open defecation (%)558.4\nProportion of children aged 12-23 months who are fully immunized (%)4482\nProportion of children who started breast feeding within 24 hours of birth5589\nProportion of population with sustainable access to an improved water source (%)8897\nProportion of diarrhea-affected children treated with oral rehydration theraphy (%)3981\n\nIndia within itself is very diverse.\nSome states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala would be at the top of the South Asian comparison if they were treated as separate countries and some others - Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh - would do enormously worse.\nIndian states which have done well had solid foundation of participatory development and social support early on and actively promoted expansion of human capabilities in terms of education and health.\nThe living condition in the poorer half of India are not much better than in the poorer half of Africa.\nThroughout the 1970's and 1980s, official poverty estimates for Tamil Nadu were higher than corresponding all-India figures.\nDuring this period, the state initiated bold social program's like mid-day meal schemes and started putting in place extensive social infrastructure - schools, health centers, roads, public transport, water supply, electricity connections and much more, resulting in better social indicators..\nThe public revenue generated has not been well utilized to improve the social infrastructure of the country.\nThe media says about Indians grabbing great jobs in the Western world and at the same time, there is an India which has a lack of proper access to toilets, healthcare and other basic provisions to lead a life with dignity. Why?\nIndia is a microcosm of different cultures.\nThough the relatively affluent form a small proportion of the population, the absolute numbers is large.\nIn the media, there is a lack of discussion on the problems of the poor.\nThe media discusses the problems of the middle-class and the middle-class of the media are the poor among the rich.\nThis can be attributed to the fact that the poor in the rich are the category of people who consume the information form the media.\nIn July 2012, there was a power blackout plunging half the country into darkness.\nAbout a third of the population (around 400 million people) are not even connected to any electricity supply.\nWhy is the power sector so inefficient?\nThe two confounding questions about India's public sector are:\n\nIn what areas can the public sector, given feasibly good arrangements, serve the interests of the public better than the private sector?\nHow can public sector be made accountable, so that they serve well?\n\nThe Chinese score higher in running a more efficient state-led power sector.\nFor instance, China has invested more than twice as much as a proportion of GDP on the power sector than has India.\nChina has built capacity in generation power in a way India has not.\nThey also generate a significant return on their investment in the power whereas the Indian power sector is perpetually deficit.\nThis is a problem of accountability.\nThe guardians of Indian power strategy face little pressure to get things right and are not asked to take responsibility for the terrible state of power planning in India.\nA related reason for limited reach and capacity of the Indian power sector is the practice of tolerating huge losses accrued by state led power utilities, which arise to a great extent from badly reasoned electricity subsidies, poor collection of electricity charges, power theft, transmission losses and other costs.\nSubsidizing power consumption for relatively better-off consumers is money which could haven been utilized to help the expansion of education for the unschooled and provide health care for the medically deprived.\nStopping the drain and face the pressure groups are hard political tasks and unless Indians - government servants, politicians, people at large - rise to this challenge and are made more accountable, Indian power sector will continue to fail.\nThe issue of accountability relates closely to that of corruption.\nCorruption is fostered and nurtured by the absence of systems of accountability. Any system that leaves government officers effectively in sole command over giving licenses without checks and invigilation can become a minefield of corrupt practices.\nThe trio of informational lacuna, social leniency and prosecutional difficulty are among the factors that sustain a culture of corruption.\nOne of the biggest obstacle to restoring accountability is the hugely pessimistic view that nothing can change.\nBut change is possible.\nThere is no single magical bullet which can bring in accountability but it can be done via a combination of moves that include reforming the administrative system via legislative and institutional changes can make a big difference like the Right to Information Act of 2005 which is a major step toward greater transparency and accessibility of information, changing incentive structures, reducing social tolerance of financial dishonesty etc.\nTechnology can be used to prevent corruption as well as dereliction of duty, like computerizing the Public Distribution System to reduce embezzlement.\nJapan gave education a central role in its national program.\nTheir Fundamental Code of Education issued in 1872 expressed a public commitment to make sure that no community with an illiterate family nor a family with an illiterate person.\nThe role of basic education in the process of development and social progress is very wide and critically important.\nThe ability to read, write and count has powerful effects on our quality of life.\nOur economic opportunities and employment prospects depend greatly on our educational achievements and cultivated skills.\nIlliteracy muffles people and their voices, contributing to their insecurity.\nBasic health education can also play a major role in tackling health problems and public health in particular.\nA large portion of the population lacks access to good public education system.\nEducation is increasingly being privatized making it unaffordable to the large amount of population.\nAbout 20 per cent of Indian children between the ages of 6 and 14 years were not attending schools.\nSurveys on school finds that only two-thirds of the pupils were present on the day of the survey with a teacher absenteeism rate of 20 per cent as well.\nSchool education in India suffers from two main issues: limitation of coverage and poor standards of education that is offered and received.\nIn the PISA Plus education survey of 2009 in which the two better-schooled states, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh participated, Indian states figured among the bottom three.\nA classic problem of school education in India is under funding by states.\nBut recent Pay Commission's have significantly boosted the salaries of teachers.\nFor example, in 2001 the ratio of teacher salary to GDP per head in China was around one, somewhere between one and two in most OECD countries but in India, it was higher than three.\nIt appears there is little evidence to suggest that high salaries are helpful in raising teaching standards.\nThe high salary of teachers increases the social distance between teachers and parents, especially in rural areas which does not help in fostering a mutual cooperation between parents and teachers.\nThe country has an odd system of Pay Commission that recommends salary scales for public employees without offering any enlightenment on how the financial burden of the wages could be financed and what implications would be on the lives of people whose wages are not determined by the Pay Commission.\nThe problems with public schools results in privatization of education system.\nBut private schools have a major problem of affordability for the poor families and disadvantages communities.\nIn the absence of competition in rural areas, private schools are extractive money-making machines.\nA greater reliance on private schools takes away from state school the children of those parents who are likely to contribute most to the critique and demands that could make state schools accountable.\nChina devotes 2.7 per cent of its GDP to government expenditure on health care compared with India's relatively miserable 1.2 per cent is directly relevant to much greater health achievements of China compared with India, for instance its much higher life expectancy (about eight years higher than India's).\nA study of health services revealed in Udaipur district (Rajasthan) reveals that more than half of health centers were found to be closed during regular opening hours and in Primary Health Centers, 36 per cent of the personnel were absent on the average.\nIndia has moved towards reliance on private health care without developing the solid rock of supporting basic public health facilities that has been the basis of almost every successful health transition in the history of the world - form Britain to Japan, from China to Brazil.\nFraud, over-medication, exploitative pricing and unnecessary surgery seems to be quite common in private health sector. For example, a study in Chennai found that 47 per cent deliveries in private sector end up with a Cesarean against the WHO norms of up to 15 per cent.\nThe government has under taken national health insurance schemes where government pays the insurance premium and the family can take up treatment in the private health care institution of their choice.\nA health system based on commercial health insurance is likely to be biased against preventive health services and non-hospitalized care.\nIt also results in selection issue where the insurance is likely to attract people prone to illness, there by raising insurance premiums or insurance companies protecting themselves by screening their clients, which runs against basic principles of equity in health care.\nIn the case of insured patients, health care providers have little incentives to contain the costs and thus health insurance raises complex efficiency issues.\nA targeted health care system where the government provides insurance to a subsection of the population causes issues like exclusion errors associated with the targeting process.\nTo solve the health care crisis in India, an universal coverage for all in a comprehensive vision of health care is required.\nInstead of expensive schemes like national health insurance schemes, as far as public health is concerned, a renewed focus on primary health centers, village level health workers, preventive health measures like immunization, sanitation, public hygiene, waste disposal, disease surveillance, vector control, health education, food safety regulation and so on are required.\nWell-planned effort to improve public facilities can lead to significant results.\nTargeting as a social policy to focus public resources has serious problems in a country like India.\nFirst, there are exclusion errors. Identifying the Below Poverty Line (BPL) households is extremely difficult and involves large exclusion and inclusion errors.\nThus, public program's on the alternative principle of universalism with self-selection have done comparatively well.\nOne example is India's school meal program where all children studying in government or government-aided schools are entitled to a nutritious midday mean free of cost.\nAnother example is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. According to official data, about 50 million households have participated in the NREGA every year since 2008-09.\nIndia has a unique cocktail of three different forms of inequality - rich-poor, caste, gender based.\nThe mutual reinforcement of severe inequalities of different kinds creates an extremely oppressive social system, where those at the bottom face extreme disempowerment.\nAt the first glance, India is the first non-Western country to have a democratic way of governance, with systematic multi-party elections, subordination of military to the civilian government, independence of judiciary and freedom of speech. But looking beyond these achievements, the massive continuation of different kind of inequalities in India provide strong evidence against considering Indian democracy to be a success.\nDemocracy is the exercise of public reason. When citizens deliberate, they exchange views and debate their supporting reasons concerning public political questions. Thus, public discussion with equal participation is a key aspect of a democracy.\nReasoning with others involves presenting one's point of view and paying serious attention to the points of view of others. This can be done via media or through public meetings. But when is it hard to get a good hearing, agitation, demonstration and campaign can indeed be a part of public reasoning.\nWhat tends to limit the adequate discussion of critically important problems of deprivation and inequality that continue to be neglected in India? The biggest barrier to the free operation of the media lies in its partiality in favor of the rich and the powerful with a serious lack of interest in the lives of the Indian poor. The economic dependence of the media on advertising creates a special focus on potential customers as a result of which the rich count more than the poor.\nThe shared interest of the privileges people, which includes the relatively affluent including the educated class dominates policy discussions and as a consequence, also governs what happens in the country.\nFor a large part of Indian population - a relatively small minority but large in absolute numbers, economic growth does fine as they are already comparatively privileged.\nBut for the vast majority, particularly those who are prevented by seizing the economic opportunities by ill health, lack of schooling, social barriers, public support is extremely important to lead a life without hunger, poverty, illness and other deprivations.\nThe basic facilities of a usable school, an accessible hospital, a toilet at home or two square meals a day are missing for a huge proportion of the Indian population in a way they are not in say China.\nTo give an example about lack of basic facilities, in 2011, half of all Indian households did not have access to toilets, forcing them to restore to open defecation compared with less than 10 per cent of household lacking this facility in Bangladesh and only 1 per cent or so in China.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/an-uncertain-glory/","title":"An Uncertain Glory"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/atomic-habits/":{"body":"Atomic Habits - small consistent routine or practice. \nYou get 1 percent better each day and after a year you will be 37 times better.\nTiny consistent changes make big results.\nSearch for marginal gains in everything you do.\nIt takes time to see results.\nYour outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits.\nIt takes time to cross the plateau of latent potential and see the change.\nTectonic plates are always under pressure and when the pressure reaches a threshold, we see the effect.\nHabits compound - both good and bad.\n\nWhen stress persists for years, it causes health issues.\nAccomplishing one extra task a day seems small, but over the years your productivity would have compounded as old task get automated, allowing time for learning new tasks or mastering new skills.\n\nGoals are about results you want to achieve.\nSystem are the process that leads to the result.\nFocus on the system, fix the inputs and the results will follow.\nYou go to gym for a day, you won't see results. But if you got to gym consistently, you will see results.\nBeliefs drive actions.\nThe first step in building a habit is updating your belief system.\nIt starts from the inside.\nMany people believe that I'm not a morning person; I'm terrible at directions.\nThese are their beliefs, which laters becomes their identity and you accept these as facts.\nLater, you begin to resist certain actions because the actions are in contrast with your belief system.\nProgress requires unlearning, continuously editing your beliefs and to upgrade, expand your identity.\nAs you repeat certain actions, the evidence accumulates and your beliefs change.\nTo wake up early, wake up 5 mins earlier every week and as the evidence accumulated, your belief changes and you become a morning person.\nDecide the kind of person you want to be and prove it to yourself with small wins.\nYou can choose your identity in every choice you make in a day.\nIt is about becoming someone.\nAs we practice a habit, our brains learns new associations and it starts performing the task unconsciouslly, freeing up cognitive load and mental capacity which can be allocated to other tasks.\nHabits create freedon, the mental space which can be used for free thinking and creativity.\nHabit is a result of a cue, craving, action and response.\nThe cue is noticing the reward.\nThe craving is about desire, achieving a reward or a desired outcome.\nThe response is the process which we take that leads to the reward.\nTo break a bad habit, eliminate its cues at first place.\nReduce its craving and you won't start the habit.\nTo stop doing a habit, make the response hard.\nIf the rewards fail to satisfy you, the action will not recur again.\nThe four cardinal rules of building a habit: make it obvious (cue), make it attractive (craving), make it easy (response), make it satisfying (reward).\nThe four rules to quit a bad habit: make it invisible (cue), make it unattractive (craving), make it difficult (response), make it unsatisfying (reward).\nYou can lookout for your habits by Pointing and Calling your daily habits. For every action, you point and say it aloud to verbalize it, thereby bringing it to the conscious level from a non-conscious level.\nOnce you identify bad habits and good habits, you can then work towards fixing and improving them.\nPeople who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.\nTo apply this strategy, fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].\nSaying that I will make a cup of tea for my wife is vague.\nBut if you make a plan, I will make my wife a cup of tea after breakfast in kitchen, it is specific and there are more chances that you will stick to it.\nThe next way is to stack habits.\nAfter [CURRENT HABIT], I will do [NEW HABIT].\nExample: After bath, I will meditate.\nYour habit should stick to a path in your existing routine.\nBy the above two methods, you give your habits a time and place in your world and make it obvious to follow.\nOur brain has about 11 million sensory neurons. Of these, 10 million are dedicated to vision. Vision is the most powerful sensory ability. Our actions depends on the visual cues. Edit the visual cues by rearraging the environment to build better habits.\nSmall change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do.\nEnvironment design helps to take back your control and become the architect of your life.\nTo drink more water, fill bottles of water in the morning and place it common locations in your house.\nThis makes it easy to drink more water.\nThe best choice should be the most obvious one.\nTo stay away from phone, keep your phone away in another room.\nThis way, you won't get tempted to pick your phone during works.\nAnother way is attach a habit with a temptation.\nSelf-control is hard.\nIt's hard to resist temptations, maintain Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions - it takes too much energy.\nUpdating the environment is easier.\nIt cuts the bad habits at the source and you spend less time in tempting situations.\nDisciplined people better structure their environment to avoid tempting situations.\nExample: If you are peaking at phones during work hours, put your phone away where it is not visible.\nAttractive habits are easy to follow.\nTo follow a new habit, bundle it with an attractive activity you need to follow.\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: 1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED] 2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\nExample: 1. After I pull out my phone (current habit), I will do ten burpees (need). 2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).\nWe imitate the habits of the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe and social norms) and the powrful (those with prestige and status).\nIt is hard to move against the grain of the culture.\nMove to a culture which follows your values and where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.\nSurround yourself with people who have the habits you want for yourself.\nTo become a reader, join a readers club.\nMake bad habits unattractive.\nHabits satisy a craving which address an underlying motives.\nA habit is a solution to the problem you need to solve.\nExample: You feel anxiety, you take a cigaratte to relax - smoking here is the solution to the underlying motive or problem which is anxiety.\nUnderlying motives of human beings are to conserve energy, obtain food and water, reproduce, reduce uncertainity etc.\nThe gap between your current state and desire state makes you to act.\nThe cue which creates the craving can be interrupted in different ways.\nBy highlighting the benefits of bad habits and making it unattractive, we can quit bad habits.\nMotion and taking action - motion makes you feel good.\nIt is about planning for the act.\nPracticing the habit is the act.\nDon't be planning. You have to act.\nTo build a habit, you need to practice it.\nOur brains takes the path of least resistance.\nWe are wired to save energy and follow the convenient path.\nThe greater the obstacle to a habit, the harder it is to follow.\nAsk How we create an environment where it is easy to do the right thing? and create an environment which reduces friction and makes good habits easy to follow and increases friction for bad habits, making them hard.\nExample: To eat more fruits, cut fruits at the start of the week. It makes it easy to eat more fruits. \nEvery day we have a handful of decisive moments which impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.\nMake healthy choices in the descisive moments.\nTwo-minute rule: You should be able to get into the habit in two minutes.\nEnforce the two-minute rule in the descisive moments.\nThis makes it easy to start.\nTo get to the gym, the first two minutes will be getting on to your workout clothes.\nShow up for the first two-minutes and the next set of habits will follow (putting on shoes, going to gym etc.)\nThe first two-minutes becomes a ritual to the larger routine.\nIf a habit feels like a chore, you will quit it.\nThe secret is to stay below the point where it feels like a chore.\nA commitment device is a choice that you make in the present that controls your action in the future.\nSome one-time actions like unsubscribing from emails can improve your productivity, buying a better mattress can give better sleep.\nAutomate as much as possible - to follow good habits as well as to make bad habits impossible.\nAlso use commitment devices to make bad habits difficult.\nTo not watch social media, uninstall the a social-media blocker app. \nTo quit a bad habit, force yourself to say the task loud before performing the bad habit.\nSaying it loud creates resistance and you will not perform the bad habit.\nWe are more likely to repeat experiences which gives us rewards, activities which satisfy us.\nAdd a little bit of immediate pleasure/reward to good habits.\nThis reinforces the good habits.\nFor example, your goal is to read more books, you can give yourself a reward of a dollar every time you read a book and save it for a trip to Europe.\nTrack your habits and goals.\nVisual measures like cross-marks which you make in the calendar when you perform a habit itself can acts as a reward and help you to stick to a habit daily. \nWhenever possible, automate the measurement.\nManual tracking should be limited only to your most important habits.\nRecord a habit immediately after it occurs.\nA pitfall of using measures is when the measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\nAlong with looking at measure, also look at the intangible benefits which you observe.\nYou can use an accountability partner - a friend or spouse to keep you accountable on a good habit.\nCreate a habit contract - a written or verbal agreement with your accountability partner.\nGenes influence everyting from the number of hours you spend watching television to your response for stress.\nGenes create area of opportunity where we can excel.\nChoose the right field of competition to maximize your odds of success.\nTake a personality test and choose habits that work for your personality. \nAsk the following questions to pick habits:\n\nWhat feels like fun to me but work to others?\nIn what areas I am better than the average person?\nWhat comes naturally to me?\nWhat makes me lose track of time? \nOnce you realize your strengths, you know where to spend your time and energy.\n\nMake the task just enough difficult to get through.\nThis is known as Goldilocks zone.\nIf the task is too difficult, we struggle.\nIf the task is too easy, we do it in autocompletion mode and we don't improve skills.\nChoose a task which is just enough hard and you will advance in small ways.\nAt some point, you get bored over training every day.\nMastery requires practice.\nStart loving boredom and stick to practice in any mood.\nWhen you reach good-enough state, you stop improving as you start doing the habit without thinking.\nIt leads to a plateau.\nReview your performance and make adjustments.\nYou need deliberate practice - constantly stretching your skills to improve and to become the elite.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/atomic-habits/","title":"Atomic Habits"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/deep-work/":{"body":"Deep work is a professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to the limit.

For each technology you reintroduce, it should serve something that you deeply value, be the best way to use technology to serve this value and determine specifically how you will use it so as to maximize the value it supports.\n\nWhat kind of applications to avoid uninstalling?\nIf your stop checking your work email, it will harm your career - so you can't take a break from it.\nKeep the ones which are necessary, remove the rest.\nThe necessary ones are usually technologies that play a key logistical role.\nWhy is solitude needed?\nSolitude is needed for reflection.\nIt is needed for us to thrive as humans.\nDuring the years of civil war, President Abraham Lincoln resided at Armed Forces Retirement Home in solitude, commuting back and forth to the White House on horseback.\nHere, there was the lack of people to demand his attention.\nThe solitude gave him time to reflect, away from the bustle of White House.\nYou need not hike to a remote cabin miles from another human being to practice solitude.\nYou can enjoy solitude in a crowded coffee shop, on a subway car so long as your mind is left to grappe only with its own thoughts without any other external input.\nThis external input can be anything, like reading a book, listening to a podcast, watching TV etc.\nEveryone benefits from regular dose of solitude.\nSolitude gives insights, an understanding of the self and closeness to others and emotional balance which gives from unhurried self-reflection.\nHow does solitude helps to be close to others?\nBy calmly experiencing seperation, it builds your appreciation for interpersonal connections when they do occur.\nAll of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room - Blaise Pascal.\nNew technologies help create a culture that undermines time alone with your thoughts.\nFor the first time in history, solitude is beginning to fade away, making it possible to completely banish solitude from your life.\nSmartphones enable solitude deprivation even the tiny moments of solitude, like standing in the queue by allowing us to take quick glances.\nPart of the problem that complicates the discussion of waning solitude is that it's easy to underestimate the severity of the phenomenon.\nMoment is an app which tracks how often and how long you look at your screen each day.\nAn average Moment user spends around three hours a day looking at their smartphone screen with only 12 percent spending less than an house and an average user picks up their phone thirty-nine times a day.\nThe numbers probably skew low as the people who downloaded an app like Moment are people who are already careful about their phone use.\nThe head of mental health services at an university says that there was a raise in anxiety and anxiety-related disorders and this raise coincided with the first incoming classes of students that were raised on smartphones and social media.\nSome practices for increasing regular time with your thoughts alone:\n\nLeave your phone at home. The urgency we feel to always have a phone with us is exaggerated.\nTake long walks. The hardest part of this is making the time. Schedule the time in advance.\nWrite letters to yourself. By composing thoughts in the structured form demanded by written prose, I've often gained clarity.\n\nOur brain is a sophisticated social computer.\nIn moments of cognitive down time, when we are not engaged in any activity, our brain defaults to thinking about our social life.\nThe loss of social connection turns out to trigger the same system as physical pains - explaining why the death of a family member, breakup or even a social snub can cause such distress.\nA simple conversation with  a store clerk requires massive amounts of neuronal computational power to take in and process a high-bandwidth stream of clues about what's going on in the clerk's mind.\nDigital communication tools encourages intreactions through short, text-based messages and approval clicks that are orders of magnitude less information laden that what we have evolved to expect.\nIn a comparison of studies on use of social media, studies that found postive results focused on specific behaviors while the studies focused on overall use found negative results.\nUsing social media tends to take people away from the real world socializing that's massively more valuable and also leaving out most of our high-performance social processing networks underused.\nThe small boosts you recieve from liking your friend's photo can't come close to spending real-world time with that same friend.\nBecause our primal instinct is so strong, its difficult to resist checking a device in the middle of a conversation with a friend, reducing the quality of the richer interaction in front of us.\nFully present to one another in a face-to-face conversation, we learn to listen, develop the capacity of empathy, experience the joy of being heard, of being understood.\nAdopt conversation-centric communication.\nPractices:\n\nDon't click like and stop leaving comments on social media posts. Why? Because they teach your mind that connection is a reasonable alternative to conversation. Clicking Like is a low-value interaction and by eliminating it, you send your mind a clear message that conversation is what counts.\nConsolidate texting. Keep your phone in Do Not Disturb mode by default, adjusting the settings so calls from a selected list (your spouse, your kid's school) do come through. This allows you to be more present when you're not texting, allowing yout to fully focus on the activity before you and paradoxically, it also upgrades the nature of your relationships.\nHold conversation office hours. Put aside times on set days during which you're available for conversation. \n\nPeople are caught in a fraught sense of obligations that being a friend means being ready to be attentive, online.\nWhen you refuse to use social media icons and comments to interact, means that some people will inevitable fall out of your social orbit - in particular, those whose relationship with you exists only over social media.\nLet them go.\nThe idea that its valuable to maintain vast numbers of weak-tie social connections is largely an invention of the past decade or so.\nPeople who take a break from technology experience distress, like withdrawal symptoms experiences by an addict.\nThis distress is due to not knowing what to do in the abscence of technology.\nFill the gap with high-quality leisure.\nAs the boundary between work and life blends, jobs become more demanding and community traditions degrade, more and more people are failing to cultivate the high-quality leisure crucial for human happiness.\nIt leaves a void that would be unbearable if confronted but that can be ignored with the help of digital noise.\nFill the void with high-quality leisure activities.\nWe might tell ourself that after a long day of work, the best reward is an evening devoid of plans and commitments.\nIn such evenings, we find ourselves several hours of watching and screen tapping, ending up more fatigued than when we began.\nBut if such an evening is spent in an activity doing something - even if it's hard - you will end the night feeling better.\nCrafts are a good source of high-quality leisure.\nPeople have a need to put their hands on tools and to make things.\nLong ago, we learned to think by using hands and manipulating the world around us.\nBut many people experience the world largely through a screen now, using hands only to poke at screens. \nWhen you do a craft, you can say to the world that this is what I have built/fixed etc.\nWhen screens replace craft, people lose the outlet for self-worth established through unambigous demonstration of skill.\nHere, social media offers a substitute source of aggrandizement - you can point to a photo of your latest visit to a retaurant, hoping for likes.\nIs something like coding on an integrated editor or video gaming count as craft?\nNo, because activities mediated by a screen exhibit a fundamentally different character than those embodied in the real world. \nA cafe in Toronto has no Wi-Fi, forgettable food, uncomfortable chairs but people queue upto three hours in the cold to visit it.\nWhy?\nIt's a board game cafe.\nThe popularity is due in large part to the social experience of playing these games.\nPlaying a board game is in a rich multimedia 3D interaction requiring a much higher use of brain, identifying the social cues of your opponent in a rich \nA good leisure activity requires real-world, structured social interactions.\nPractices for adopting high-quality leisure:\n\nFix or build something every week, like changing your own car oil, installing a new ceiling-mounted light fixture, starting a garden plot.\nSchedule in advance the time you spend on low-quality leisure.\nJoin something - a local volunteer group, a committee at your temple etc\nFollow leisure plans - have an objective and habits along with the strategies for achieving them. The objective should have specificity in it - a vague goal is less likely to succeed.\n\nThe battle with social media companies is lopsided as they have put in huge amount of financial resources to gain our attention. \nGoogle's market cap is over $800 billion, Facebook is over $500 billion, while in contrast ExxonMobil is $370 billion.\nExtracting eyeball minutes has become more lucrative than extracting oil.\nAt the core of the attention economy is the smartphone's ability to deliver advertisements to users at all points during the day, as well as to help services gather data from these users to target those ads with unprecedented precision.\nCompanies like Facebook innovated the field of attention enginnering, figuring out how to exploit psychological vulnerabilities to trick users into spending far more time on these services than they actually intended.\nThe average user now sepnds 50 minutes per day on Facebook products alone.\nTo sustain this compulsive use, you cannot have people think critically about how they use their phone.\nFacebook in recent years has presented itself as a foundational technology, like electricity or mobile telephone, so that people don't critically about how they use its services.\nPractices for extracting value from these services and to avoid exploitation:\n\nDelete social media from your phone. When you need to access it, you can access via web-browser and by this, you also reduce the ability of the service to distract you.\nTurn your device into single purpose computers. When you allow yourself access to all that your general-purpose computers offers at all time, it will also give access to apps and websites enginneered to hijack your attention. Use tools like Freedom to aggressively control access to any website or app. Have them blocked by default.\nUse social media like a professional: Pros use social media to extract large amount of value for their professional and personal lives, while avoiding much of the low-value distractions these services provide. Have a careful plan on how you use each of the social media services, maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.\nEmbrace slow media - a small amount og high-quality offerings is usually superior to a larger amount of low-aulity fare (a few detailed reports are more informative than large number of breaking news).\nDumb down your smartphone.\n\n\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/digital-minimalism/","title":"Digital Minimalism"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/ego-is-the-enemy/":{"body":"What is ego?\nIt is something which says I am an entrepreneur because I struck out on my own.\nIt is what which says I am going to win because I am currently leading.\nIt says I am important/special because I think I should be/I am chosen.\nIt says I am rich because I made some money.\nPrivately thinking you're better than others is still pride.\nEgo looks at your past achievements and gets you satisfied with it preventing you from doing real work.\nWhen we face failure, ego tells us that we do not deserve this failure.\nEgo tells us we deserve better.\nWe fail a lot and ego stops us from going through the failure.\nLife throws challenges at us when everything seems to be going good.\nEvery moment, in the adversity, you can choose to have it as an alive time -

Harper is a high-brow magazine while True Story is a low-brow.\nNext time you read that a average man brushes his teeth 1.02 times a day, ask yourself a question: How can anyone have found such a thing?\nThe source of bias can be invisible - always allow yourself some degree or scepticism about results.\nA report based on a sampling must use a representative sample, which is one from which every source of bias is removed.\nA sample is truley random when every name or thing in the whole group has an equal change to be in the sample.\nBut a purely random sample is difficult and expensive to obtain.\nIn a survey, the sample of population can be far from random (first level).\nThe questions in the questionnaire in the survey are a sample of possible questions (second level).\nThe answer which the respondandant gices is also a sample of his or her attitude and experience on such question (thirs level).\nWhen you read the result of survey, question what is the sample for the data?\nDoes the sample have bias in it?\nThe word average can disgusie any of the three - mean, median and mode.\nAll the three averages come together when the data follows a normal distribution.\nWhen reading an average based statistic, like the average American family income was $6,940 in some specified year, ask what kind of average is this - mean, median or mode, what family means, who says so, how he knows and how accurate the figure is.\nWhen told the results of a survey, ask How many samples were used to make the results? because a well-biased samples can be used to produce almost any result anyone may wish.\nWith a large group, any difference produced by chance is likey to be a samll one.\nBut with a small group, any kind of result can be produced by chance.\nTake a coin and toss it ten times - you will get 8 times head which proves that heads come up 80 per cent of time.\nBut toss it large enough times and heads will come close to 50 per cent of the time - a result that is represents real probability.\nOnly when there is a substantial number of trails is the law f averages a useful description or prediction.\nDegree of significance is a figure that represents whether a result is a real result rather than something produced by chage.\nIt is expressed as a probability.\nWhen it is said that there are nineteen chances out of twenty that the figures have a specified degree of precision, it means that less than five per cent of result are produced by chance.\nFor most purposes, nothing less than five per cent level of significance is good enough.\nAlong with average, there should also be range.\nRange represents the deviation in the results.\nThink about sampling results in ranges - all sampling results have an associated error representing how accurate the measurement is.\nYou might take 61 degres as a comfortable annual mean temperature in California, but you can freeze or roast if you ignore the range. For San Nicolas, it is 47 to 87 degrees but for the desert, it is 15 to 104.\nTake this sentence from a magazine: a new cold temper bath which triples the hardness of steel, from Westinghouse.\nIt looks like quite a development unitl you try to put your finger on what it really means. Does the new bath make any kind of steel three times as hard as it was before treatment? Or does it produce a steel three times as hard as any previous teel? Or what does it do?\nWhen words won't do the work and numbers in the tabular format cannot convince, draw a picture.\nGraphs are often made out of propotion to exaggerae results.\nExaggeration is done by reducing/increasing the frequency or range in the marks on the graph's axis.\nA chart with a picture of a man to represent a million men, a moneybag representing a million dollars are known as pictorial graphs.\nPictorial graphs have eye-appeal and it is also capable of becoming a fluent, devious and successful liar.\nThey dramatize the difference in results to suit writer's argument and to create impressions of exaggeration in the reader's mind, thereby sensationalizing the facts to make a better story.\nA bar chart is capable of deceit too.\nLook with suspicion on any version in which the bars change their widths as well as their length while representing a single factor.\nWhen looking at the graphs look for the base line.\nSemi-attached figures - numbers which do not give a complete information.\nSuppose an article says a new drug kills half the cold caussing germs in a test tube.\nAnd you believe it to be true.\nBut the issue with such semi-attached figure is that, they don't answer questions like do the germs in test tube are cold causing germs or is it random germs, do the medicine which works in a test tube will work in the human body after dilution to prevent throat irritation?\nA report says 27 per cent of the doctors smoke Throaties more than any other brand.\nSo what? Do the doctors know anything about tobacco brands than you do?\nNo.\nDo the doctors know any inside information that permits them to smoke the least harmful cigaratte? They don't.\nThis 27% - a semi-attached figure somehow gives a false sense of information.\nA juice extractor is said to extract 26% more juice.\nWhat does that figure mean?\nIt means that compared to an old-fashioned hand reamer, the juice extractor is 26% more efficient.\nThe 26% is totally irrelevant without additional contextual information about the juicer.\nMore people wer ekilled in aeroplane last year than in 1910.\nDoes it mean aeroplanes are more dangerous?\nIt means more people are flying today.\nThere are many ways of expressing any figure.\nA company reported a low net earnings of only 1.1 per cent of sales.\nThe number is distressingly small.\nThe catch is that annual return on investment is not the same as earning on total sales.\nIf I purchase an article at 99 cent every morning and sell it each afternoon for one dollar, I will make only 1 per cent on total sales but 365 per cent on invested money during the year.\nMagazines, corporates, advertisers chose the method which serves the best purpose at hand in reporting numbers.\nAn association between two factors is not proof that one has caused another.\nSometimes, there might be a hidden third factors which might be causing the other factors which correlate.\nA statement of relationship should be put through a sharp inspection.\nIn a small sample, substantial correlation can be found purely by chance.\nTwo correlating factors might be influenced by an unknown third factor.\nCorrelation can be produced by a stream of events, the trends of the time.\nFor example, the salaries of Presbyterian ministers in Massachusettts and the price  of rum in Havana had a close relationship (both growing). \nIn this case, the factor responsible is a third factor - the historic and world-wide rise in price level of practically everything.\nPercentage and confusion of base: A Christmas deal says save 100 per cent - it sounds like a great offer but it is only due to confusion of base. The price-reduction is only fifty per cent of the actual price but the saving is computed from the new reduced price.\nTo offset a pay cut of 50 per cent, you must get an increment of 100 per cent.\nHow to prod statistical data for lies? Use these five questions:\n\n\nWho says so?\nThere might be a newspaper which aims to say a good story, labour or management with wage level stakes. Lookout for conscious bias - bias that may be introduced to produce favorable results and suppression of the unfavorable, using one year for comparison and a favorable year for another, cases where a mean over a median may be more informative.\nLook for unconscious bias - the survey may be from Cornell University but the interpretation will be of the author who is writing the article. Check whether the university or the laboratory stands behind the interpretation.\n\n\nHow does he know?\nAsk questions on the sample size - is the sample large enough to provide a valid conclusion? In case of correlation, ask is it big enough to mean anything?\n\n\nWhat's missing?\nA correlation without a mesaure of reliability (probable error, standard error), a mean without range, average without specifying mean, media or mode are not to be taken seriously. Look out for semi-attached figures. When looking at percentages, look for bases from which the percentages are taken.\n\n\nDid somebody change the subject?\nMore reported cases of a disease are not always the same thing as more cases of the disease - it can also mean better diagnosis.\n\n\nDoes it make sense?\nMany a statistics is false on its face.

As we retrieve a memory, it gets overlapped with some other information, like the current context, perception or thoughts. \nThe more often we retrieve a more, the more accessible it becomes. \nHow well we remember an information depends on:\n\nstorage strength - how well learned something is. For example, multiplication table which is well-drilled into your brain in school.\nretrieval strength - how easily the brain can retrieve the stored information.\nYou can retrieve the names of your new neighbors when they had just introduced themselves (high retrieval strength) but tomorrow morning, you would have forgotten them (low storage strength).\n\nWhen we forget something and then try to recollect it, we increase the retrieval strength of that piece of information\n.\nThus forgetting and recalling are active parts of remembering.\nThe harder your brain has to work to dig out a memory, the greater the increase in retrieval and storage strength.\nLearned information, when not used, decays from memory.\nForgetting is nature's spam filter.\nIt allows the brain to focus on the important stuff while letting go of the not so important stuffs.\nTo focus on something, the brain must apply a filter to block the distracting information pop-up.\nForgetting helps learning by allowing the brain to focus on the important information/task at hand.\nIt blocks distracting information and clears away useless clutter.\nScientists performed an experiment in which they asked divers to study words and recall them.\nThose who studied under-water remembered better when they were under-water instead of land.\nWe recall better if the environment of original learning is reinstated during recall.\nAs we learn, our brain stores the information along with the contextual-cues from the environment (music, light, background colors, moode).\nHence, when the contextual-cues are presented again, our brain can recall the better in the context than without the context.\nOur brain stores information along with the associated context.\nRecreating the context during recall activates neurons related to the context as well as the information, helping in better recollection in presence of the context compared to a recollection in the abscence of the associated context.\nTo apply this technique, learn the same information at varying backgrounds, like once when playing a guitar music in the background, next in a coffee shop.\nCramming information by pulling an all-nighter help you in the immediate test but it does not help in storing the information for long-term.\nThe spacing effects says that distributing the learning over a period helps in better information storage.\nFor example, learning a piece of information (can be a text, or a tune in your guitar) for 5 continuous days will have less retention than the same information learned 5 times spaced over a month.\nTo build and retain foreign vocabulary, scientific information or other factual information, it is best to review the materials one or two days after the initial study, then a week later, then a month later and then, the intervals are longer.\nTesting measures how well you remember and it alters what we remember and changes how we subsequently organize the information in our minds.\nSelf-examination, which is studying a prose for five minutes and then turning over the page to recite what you can without looking (a kind of testing) improves learning. \nIn an experiment, students who took a test after reading a passage performed better in a final test at the end of two months compared to students who did not take an immediate test after reading.\nThis demonstrates that immediate recall in the form of a test aids in retention of learning.\nOne effective way of self-examination is to share what you learn with your spouse, brother or anyone, as an old saying goes that you have to teach it to understand it better.\nTesting is a kind of retrieval practice.\nTaking a pretest where you guess answers to a question, then reading a passage or learning something helps you answer better in a later test.\nThe act of guessing before reading engages your mind in a more demanding way and helps in making a strong imprint of the knowledge which you are going to study next.\nThis act of pretesting is most helpful when people get prompt feedback. \nThere are four steps in the aha moment ideas which helps us break hard problem:\n\nstep 1: preparation - we load our brain with the problem. In this step, we attack the problem with different methods but we fail.\nstep 2: incubation - we do another task, allowing the brain to incubate the ideas.\nstep 3: aha moment - we get illuminated by the idea\nstep 4: verification - verifying that the idea works\nIncubation breaks helps only when we have reached an impasse.\n\nCreative leaps in idea often come during downtime that follows a period of immersion in a story or a topic.\nUnfinished jobs or goals linger in memory longer than finished ones.\nHaving a goal or an unfinished task tunes our perception to fulfilling it.\nStart working on large projects as soon as possible and stop when you get stuck, allowing for percolation of ideas to happen and then resume the work.\nIn a study on badminton players, three groups were made to practice three different kind of serves. Group A did blocked practice where the group rehearsed only one kind of serve in a session, then moved on to the next type of serve. In group B, the participants practiced three different kind of serves in loops. Group C practiced serves by trying any serve they wanted but no more than two of the same ones in a row. Group C, which practiced by making random serves performed better than other group. Similary, a study on mathematics students found that students who practiced different in a mixed setting (a problem in algebra followed by a problem in a geometry) performed better than students who practiced only one kind of problem in a practice session.\nVarying the practice - by taking different approaches, instead of focusing on one particular kind of approach help us to internalize and generalize the information better.\nThe mixing of items, skills or concepts during practice help us to see the distinctions between each item clearly as well as help us to achieve a clearer grasp of each item.\nSleep.

Trump lifting an aeroplace is more memorable than your neighbor walking his dog in the street.\nTo memorize the card sequence, pick cards in bunches of three and connect the first cards person with second cards action and third cards object.\nAssign this image to the first place in your mental palace.\nThen move to the next place in your mental and assign it an image corresponding to the next three cards - you can think of the person doing the action with an object in that place.\nTo recall, traverse your mental palance again from the first place to last place recollecting the person performing an action on that object at that place mapping back to the cards.\nThe key here is remember the mental palace and the association between PAO image and the card.\nMemorizing a person's name: associate an image describing the name along with the person's face.\nMemorizing a speech: The best way to memorize a speech is point by point, not word by word. An orator delivering a speech should make one image for each topic he wants to cover and can place the images in a memory palace or a locus.\nOn remembering a poem\n\nRepeat a line two or three times before trying to see it is a series of images.\nTo visualize and, the and other conjunctions, articles and syntactical connectors, use a shorthand images that would stand in for them. \nMake a list of images corresponding to words - a dictionary of images for the common words that can't be easily visualized.\nTo create an image for the unimaginable word, visualize a similarly sounding or punning word in its place.\nOr you can use a memory of syllables - where you assign every syllable an image - breaking words into its constituent syllables and then creating an image for each syllable based on other word that begins with the syllable.\nTo remember the poem, recollect the sequence of images.\n\nWhy must one memorize poems? Poems, ancient texts or religious texts contains pieces of wisdom. It can guide you in tight spots. To really learn a text, one has to memorize it. Memorizing texts help shape one's character - because when you memorize, you ruminate on them and in the process, make the wisdom part of your character.\nHistory of external memory\nHumans started to record sound - speeches, stories told over generations by giving the sound a shape and writing it.\nLater inventions like punctutals, spaces came which made the shapes more readable.\nThen the printing press which can reproduce information stored in books.\nNow, we have hard drives and massive other storage systems storing lots of information.\nThough there are external memories like harddrives, memory is important.\nBecause new innovations are created by combining and recombining information and ideas in the brain.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/moonwalking-with-einstein/","title":"Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/never-split-the-difference/":{"body":"Herb Cohen's You Can Negotiate is easier to read but this is helpful when you don't\nhave power, like when you are negotiating with your landlord.\nLife is negotiation.\nYour career, your finances, your reputation - at some point, all of these hinges on your ability to negotiate.\nNegotiation is means to get what you want in life.\nThe first step to master daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating.\nNegotiation is the heart of collaboration.\nAsking questions is a passive aggressive approach.\nThe process of negotiation should be approached with a mindset of discovery - of\nwhat the other side wants.\nYour goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible.\nSmart people have trouble being negotiators - they're so smart they think they\ndon't have anything to discover.\nDon't assume, have hypothesis.\nEach new piece of information takes a step towards the end goal and discard false hypothesis\nabout the wants of other side.\nIn a hostage negotiation, FBI makes multiple people to listen to a call.\nIt's not easy to listen well.

an upright gait required narrower hips but the babies head were getting bigger.\nWomen who gave birth earlier when the infant's brain and head were relatively small and supple fared better and lived to have more children.\nThus, natural selection favoured earlier births.\nBut this also resulted in human babies takings years for their development.\nFor millions of years, humans hunted small creatures and we were at the middle of the food chain.\nBut now we are at the top of the food chain.\nA significant step on to our way to the top was the domestication for fire.\nIt allowed us to cook food, which along with killing parasites and germs, also made it easier for digest.\nWhen a chimp spent 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people to eat cooked food.\nHumans first evolved in East Africa 2.5 million years ago and left their homeland to settle North Africa, Europe and Asia.\nHumans in Europe and western Asia evolved into Neanderthals, the most eastern region of Asia was populated by Homo Erectus.\nNeanderthals had more muscular features and could survive in cold climates.\nAbout 100,000 years ago, some Sapiens group encountered Neanderthals but failed to secure a firm footing.\nBut then, when Sapiens band left Africa 70,000 years ago, they drove Neanderthals and all other human species from Earth.\nHow?\nThe most commonly believed theory is that Sapiens brain got an accidental genetic mutation which allowed the brain to communicate.\nBut what makes it different from communication of other animals? \nThe unique feature about this is they were able to transmit information about things which did not exist at all - things which exist only in our imagination.\n\nThey were able to gossip, which meant reliable information can shared about other Homo Sapiens, allowing small bands to expand into larger bands.\nThey were able to communicate prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world - like, the lion is near the river today, so don't go there.\n\nWithout an ability to compose fiction, Neanderthals were unable to cooperate effectively in large numbers.\nWith cognitive revolution, Sapiens were able to change their behaviour quickly and transmit more information. \nThis new ability allowed Sapiens to plan and carry out complex actions, build larger and more cohesive groups and cooperate between very large number of strangers resulting in rapid revolution of social behaviour. \nAn alpha male in a bunch of chimps wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition.\nFor chimpanzees to cooperate, members of the group should know each other intimately.\nTies between coalition members are via intimate contact - hugging, touching, kissing in chimps.\nBut such a coalition sustains only to a certain threshold size of group (100 - 150).\nWhen the group grows too large, its social order destabilizes and the band splits.\nBut humans can cooperate in large numbers.\nIt is the due to the ability to hold myths and imagine.\nBees don't setup Republic of Bees because their brains can't imagine what does not exist.\nPeople imagined limited liability companies, nation, empires, legal systems, gods and demons.\nThey all exist only in our imagination and these myths are the intrinsic fabrics which hold the society together.\nAn imagined reality is something that everyone believes in and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.\nThe first big imprint of Homo Sapiens on other species was 45,000 years ago in Australia.\nThe Australian sub-continent was not inhabited by any Sapiens until then.\nA theory suggests that Sapiens living in Indonesian archipelago developed the first seafaring societies and reached Australia. \nBut when the first Sapiens reached Australia, within a few thousand years, they wiped out large marsupials and other gaints living in Australia, like gaint koalas, dragon-like lizards, giant diprotodon etc.\nAbout 90 percent of Australia's megafauna disappeared.\nWhereas in other parts of the land Homo Sapiens and other animals co-evolved, when humans set their foot first in Australia, these animals there were not used to humans.\nHaving mastered fire, Sapiens faced with the threat of large giants burned forest to suit their needs, thus changing the ecology.\nSince the large animals also had long pregnancy, it made their extinction easier.\nThis is the First Wave of Extinction by Homo Sapiens.\nAs Homo Sapiens settled in various parts of the planet, like in Americas, Australia and other smaller places like Cuba, it was also accompanied by ecological disaster.\nUntil 10,000 years ago, Sapiens continued to live by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals.\nThen, Sapiens began to devote all their time and effort to manipualitng the lives of a few animal and plant species.\nThus, the agricultural revolution began changing the way humans lived.\nIt turned foragers into farmers.\nWe don't know much about the foragers because the horizon of possibilities is very broad.\nThe only thing we can safely say about them is that they lived in small bands numbering several dozen or at most several hundred individuals.\nThey foraged for food, materials and knowledge - to survive, they need a detailed mental map of their territory, to know the growth patterns of each plant and the habits of animals, food which were nourishing, which made you sick etc.\nThe average foraged had wider, deeper and more varied knowledge of her immediate surrounding than most of her modern descendants.\nEvidence from fossilised skeletons indicate that ancient foragers were less likely to suffer from starvation or malnutritions than their peasant descendants.\nTheir secret of success is their varied diet whereas farmers tend to eat a very limited and unbalanced diet.\nThey also suffered from less diseases as lot of diseases originated from domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after agricultural revolution.\nDuring the time of foraging, a few hours a day were spent on foraging and the rest of the time was used for social activities.\nBut as we become farmers, we tilled soil, carried water buckets, plucked weeds from dawn to dusk.\nWhen we are foragers, we had a higher supply of nutrients as we ate a wider variety of plants and animals but it changed with farming as our diet primarily become rice, wheat, potatoes and others resulting in lower supply of nutrients.\nFarming caused people to settle in places, resulted in congested town and cities which also lead to spread of infectious diseases from domesticated animals.\nFarming helped us to increase our population though the children were more malnourished and starved than children of foragers. \nChild deaths were common.\nThen, why did we farm?\nThe rise of farming was a very gradual affair spread over centuries and millennia.\nThe change proceeded by stages, each of which involved just a small alteration in daily life.\nAbout 18, 000 years ago, the last ice age gave way to a period of global warming.\nAs temperature rose, so did rainfall and wheat multiplied and spread.\nAs people begin eating wheat, they inadvertently spread its growth - since its impossible to eat wheat without first winnowing, grinding and cooking, people who gathered them to carry them to their camps also spread them.\nWhen humans burned forest, it also helped wheat as it allowed wheat to grow faster.\nAt first, humans might have camped for four weeks during harvest.\nA generaltion later, as wheat multiplied and spread, the camp must have lasted for five weeks, then six weeks and finally, it became a permanent village.\nThough settlements were hot bed for infectious diseases, bulging granaries tempted thieves and enemies, compelling them to start building walls and doing guard duty, humans didn't abandon farming.\nWhy?\nGeneration of small changes accumulated and transformed the society.\nBy then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently.\nIt was an accumulation of mistakes over generation and soon, people forgot that their old way of foraging and farming was the only way which remained.\nLuxuries are trap - farming suggested that higher hard work will lead to more harvest and then we stopped doing what we liked doing and more time was spent working hard.\nLuxury tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations.\nAgricultural revolution left farmers life generally more difficult and less satisfying than foragers.\nThough the sum total of food at disposal of human-kind enlarged, the extra food didn't translate into a better diet or more leisure.\nWho was responsible? Neither kings nor merchants.\nThe culprits were a handful of plant species, including wheat, rice and potatoes.\nWheat didn't like rocks and pebbles.\nSapiens broke their back clearing fields, irrigating them etc.\nCultivating wheat provided much food per unit of territory and it allowed Homo Sapiens to multiply exponentially and at the same time, it kept more people alive under worst conditions.\nHistory is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing field and carrying water buckets.\nOf the thousands of species that our ancestors hunted and gathered, only a few were suitables candidates for farming and herding. \nThose few specied lived in particular places and those are the places where agricultural revolutions occured.\nAs we domesticated animals, we also altered the constitution of the herds on which we preyed.\nIn a bunch of sheeps, the sheep which was hard to control and the sheeps which were thin was slaughtered first.\nWith eash passing generation, the sheep becamse fatter and more submissive.\nThis selective hunting of sheeps and the evolution of remaining lead us to a more controlled set of sheeps which are fatty and easy to control.\nDomesticated animals are also the most miserable creatures.\nThey are slaughtered early (why keep a cock for three years if it has reached its maximum weight in three months?).\nFarmers developed techniques to lock animals inside pens and cages etc.\nAs people settled and came to closer contact with animals, it also resulted in more diseases and epidemics.\nWhen we were foragers, epidemics were rare because a group was small.\nDuring this time, we also started thinking about the future.\nThe agricultural revolution started bringing about worries of the future in human mind - when will it rain, build up reserves etc.\nAll cooperation networks - from cities to empires are imagined orders and the social norms that sustained them were based neither on ingrained instincts of humans to stick together nor on personal acquintaces but rather on belief in shared myths.\nFor example, the Americans believes in the American founding document.\nThe American Declaration of Independence says, all men are created but biology says people have evolved. \nIt says about liberty, rights but there is no such thing in biology.\nThese values exists only in our imagination and it is an imagined order.\nIt is not objectively true but believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society.\nImagined orders are embedded in the material world, it shapes our desires as we take instructions from the dominant myth of the day and it is inter-subjective. \nThe imagined orders also created social hierarchies, an another product of human imagination resulting in unjust discrimnation.\nDuring the period of Hamurabi, the hierarchy was superiors, commoners and slaves.\nThere always existed Us vs Them - Homo Sapiens were evolved to think this way.\nThese are social hierarchies created in the mind.\nHow did social hierarchies come into existence?\nSocial hierarchies were first created by a chance historical event and then it starts a vicious cycle in which the social hierarchy gets deeply embedded into the social system.\nFor example, blacks are poor, they get poor education and face discriminatory laws and because of these, as adults they end up poor.\nThe one hierarchy which existed in all societies is the hierarchy of gender.\nWhy are most societies patriachial than matriachial?\nThough there are plenty of theories, none of them gives a convincing answer.\nMemory overload - our natural brain is not adapt to handle numerical quantities.\nIt is more adapt to handle information like where can food be found, what berries can cure stomach ache and other such information.\nEvolution pressures have adapted the human brain to store immense quantites of botanical, zoological, topographical and social information.\nEmpires cannot function without collecting taxes, keeping account of transactions, inventories and food grains which are required for its functioning. \nBut how do we account for these information in an empire-size database? \nThus came the first writing system - a method of storing infromation through material signs.\nThe early writing could communicate only numerical information (the amount of grains etc.) and not poems or stories.\nHence, they are called as partial scripts.\nA critical step was the invention of a new partial script - the numbers from 0 to 9.\nThey were invented by Hindus and Arabs got the credit when they invaded India and spread it througout Middle East and to Europe.\nStories like the Hindu Mahabaratha, Greek Iliad began as oral works.\nSoon, as the need for storing more information grew, full scripts were developed.\nFull scripts allowed people to write poetry, romance, dramas etc.\nThe new writing system was a cognitive burden on the brain and schools for scribes, clerks, accountants were opened.\nThe immense diversity of imagined realities that Sapiens invented and the resulting diversity of behavior patterns are the main components of what we call cultures.\nIt can be the set of myths which we hold together, the way we do certain things, etc.\nOnce cultures appear, the way they develop and change is called as 'history.'\nEvery culture today is a mix of other cultures.\nThere is no pure culture.\nWhen British ruled India, Indians adopted western values and habits like eating with forks, democracy, freedom and self-individualism.\nWith these new-found values, they asked the British to respect their new values of freedom.\nIs the Indian culture before British the authentic Indian culture?\nNo, it is a mix of the Mughal culture and the Indian culture which existed before Mughal and so on.\nEvery culture has its typical beliefs, norms and values but these are in constant flux.\nContradictions exist in a culture and these contradictions serve as a engine of cultural development, responsible for the creativity and dynamism of our species.\nHistory has a direction and that direction is towards unity. \nIt is a long term process and to understand it, we should look at the scale of millenia rather than centuries.\nBefore long, there existed a number of seperate human worlds at any given moment on planet Earth.\nToday, the planet is a single unit.\nOver the last few centuries, all cultures were changed almost beyond recognition by a flood of global influences.\nTomatoes are Mexican origins, potatoes reached Poland no more than 400 years ago etc.\nThe global unification occured as empires grew and trade intensified.\nThis global unification was fuelled by money, empire and religion.\nMoney is first big unifier.\nThe followers of Christ and Allah fought wars, killing thousands and turned cities into ruins - all for the greater glory of Chrish or Allah.\nAs the Christians gained upper hand, they issued new gold and solver coinds bearing the cross to mark their victory.\nThe Muslim merchants in North Africa conducted business using these Christian coins.\nBefore money, there was barter system.\nAnd before coins, there existed many other forms of money like cowry shells and grains.\nMoney is an universal medium of exchange, allowing people to convert almost anything to anything else.\nBecause money can convert, store and transport wealth easily and cheaply, it made a vital contribution to the appearance of complex commercial networks and dynamic markets.\nCowry shells and dollars have value only in our common imagination.\nTheir worth is not inherent in their physical properties like shape, color.\nThey succeeded because of trust in the collective imagination.\nI trust money because my neighbor trust it.\nMy neighbor trust it because I trust it.\nWe all trust it because the government trust it and demands them in taxes.\nHow did gold become valued across different cultures?\nLet's assume that Mediterranean merchants values gold and Indian's don't. \nThen, finding gold to be cheap in India, they can buy more gold in India cheaply and sell it dearly.\nThis demand for gold in India will cause its value to increase in India as well and within a short time, the value of gold in India and Mediterranean would be similar. \nThe trade between two groups made gold valuable to both of them.\nTwo universal principles of money: universal convertibility, universal trust.\nPeople spoke different languages, worshipped different gods but all believed in gold and silver coins.\nOf the $60 trillion money, only $6 trillion is cash.\nThe rest of it lies in electronics servers.\nThe second unifier is empires - a political order ruling over distinct people with different cultural identies and territies along with flexible borders and a potentially unlimited appetite.\nAs empires were created, they absorbed the tribes and people in that region, gradually obliterated the unique characteristics of numerous people, forging out of them new and much large groups.\nThe acculturation and assimilation of various empires practices forged into today's political, social and cultural practices.\nFor example, as Europeans conquered much of the globe, Indians, Africans and others learned English and adopted Western ideologies like capitalism, communism, feminism.\nIndians are passionate cricket players and tea drinkers, both of which are British legacies.\nThe fall of an empire gave raise to another empire.\nReligion can be defined as a system of human laws that is founded on a belief in superhuman laws.\nA leading theory on the origin of gods says that when humans were not able to communicate with the goats asking it to be more fertile, god took centre stage as a mediator between the humans and the mute plants and animals.\nThe earliest religion are animist religion where people prayed to tress, rocks and other inanimate objects.\nMonotheism was not able to solve evil (what gives rise to evil if there is only one god who is good?).\nIt could explain diseases, famines etc only in a case when it believes that there is only one god and that is evil.\nPolytheism is conducive to religious tolerance as they believe on one supreme and completely disinterested power on one hand and on the other hand, gods with partial and biased powers, like rain god, war god.\nThe Hindus believed in Atman - the one supreme power and many other gods like Lakshmi and Saraswathi.\nMonotheists tended to be far more fanatical and missionary than polytheists.\nCapitalism, communism are also a kind of religion.\nThey are established on a myth and they exist only in our imagination. \nIslam, Buddhism, Communism are all religions because all are systems of human norms and values that are founded on belief in super-natural order.\nHumanist religion sanctify Homo Sapiens.\nHumanism is a belief that Homo Sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally different from the nature of all other animals and phenomena.\nBut scientist studying human organsim has found no soul there and they increasingly argue that human behavior is determined by genes, hormones and synapses rather than free will - the same forces that determine the behavior of chimpanzees, wolves and ants.\nHistory has hindsight fallacy.\nIt is non-deterministic and it can't be predicted as it is chaotic.\nAn event of past will seem obvious if viewed from the future but at present, it has many paths forward.\nSo many forces are at work and their interactions are so complex that extremely small variations in the strength of forces and the way they interact produce huge differences in outcomes.\nHistory is a level-two chaotic system.\nThe action of predicting history itself make the prediction false - like a stock market.\nThere is no proof that history is working for the benefit of humans because we lack an objective scale to measure such benefit.\nFor example, arms race spreads from one country to another. \nAt the end, the balance of power remains same but billions of dollar which could have spent on education or health gets wasted.\nThe pattern of behavior in arms race only benefits itself.\nModern science differs from previous traditions of knowledge in three critical ways:\n\nthe willingness to admit ignorance.\nthe centrality of observation and mathematics.\nthe acquisition of new powers.\n\nIf scientific evidence shows that many of the myths are doubtful, how can we hold society together? One way is take a scientific theory and unscientifically, declare it as the final and absolute truth or leave science out of it and live in accordance with a non-scientific absolute truth.\nScience is an expensive affair and it is shaped by economic, political and religious interests.\nWhy does someone fund a project? Because they believe it can help attain some power like political, economic or religious goal.\nThe ideology helps in justifying the cost of the research.\nScience, industry and military technology intertwined only with the advent of capitalist system and the industrial revolution.\nIn 1770, Europeans had no significant technological advantage over Muslims, Indians and Chinese. In 1775, Asia accounted for 80 percent of the world economy.\nHow did they manage to control the world economy by 1900?\nHow did they manage to open a gap between themselves and rest of the world in the 19th century?\nWhy did the military-industrial-scientific complex blossom in Europe rather than India?\nThe non-Europeans lacked the values, myths, judicial apparatus and sociopolitical structure that took centuries to form and mature in the West and which could not be copied and internalised rapidly.\nEuropeans were used to think and behave in scientific and capitalist ways even before they enjoyed any significant technological advantages.\nThey admitted that I don't know what's out there and felt compelled to go out and make new discoveries.\nThe conquest of territory and the conquest of knowledge was tightly intertwined in Europe.\nIn the 18th and 19th CE, every military expedition to distant lands also had on board scientists who set out to make scientific disocveries.\nWhen the Muslims conquered India, they did not bring anthropologist to study the culture or geologist to study the Indian soils. But the British did all these - they launched the Great Survery of India in 1802 which lasted 60 years.\nBehind the meteoric rise of science and empire is capitalism.\nWhat is the foundation of capitalism?\nIt is the credit system.\nCredit is backed by a trust in the future that the borrower will be able to pay a higher amount tomorrow when the borrowed money is used to bring in real economic growth. The economic growth further increases the trust in future, opening the way for even more credit.\nThe sacred commandment in capitalism is The profits of production must be reinvested in increasing production. \nThe capitalist argues that greed is good as a shoemakers who makes profit will reinvest the profit to make more shoes, thereby helping people around.\nCapitalism resulted in slavery, blinding people to anything that might stand in their way for profits. Examples are the the Atlantic slave trade, Great Bengal Famine.\nMarkets by themselves offer no protection against fraud, theft or violence.\nIt is the job of political system to ensure trust by legislations and to enforce law.\nWithout this, it leads to loss of trust, dwindling credit and economic depression.\nHow did the Dutch won over Spaniards and Portugese in conquering colonies? \nThe Dutch was backed a powerful financial system.\nHow did they win the trust of the financial system?\n\nThey were sticklers in repaying loans.\nThe country's judicial system protected private property rights.\n\nThe Spain king took money from people - there was no legal judicial system to protect individuals.\nThe Dutch had the system and the Dutch traders were able to protect their money against the thiefs and cheaters.\nCapital trickles away from dictatorial state that fails to defend private individuals and their property.\nThe Dutch merchants financed conquest by getting loans and also by selling shares in their companies that entitled their holders to receive a portion of the company's profit.\nThe Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC for short is a Dutch join-stock company chartered in 1602, which sold shared to raise money, build ships and bring back goods from other countries.\nIt also financed military actions against competitors and pirates. \nIn this way, when VOC merchants first arrived in Indonesia in 1602 for commercial purposes, to secure their commerical interest and maximize profit of shareholders, the merchants began to fight against local potentates who charged inflated tariffs as well as against European competitors.\nIt recruited mercanaries, built forts and conducted full-scale battle and seiges.\nVOC ruled Indonesia for 200 years and the Dutch state took control of Indonesia only in 1800.\nCredit rating indicates the probability the country will pay its debts. In addition to economical data, political, social and cultural factors are also taken into account.\nA country with despostic government, endemic warfare and a corrupt judicial system will usually receive low-credit rating and with a low rating, it can't raise necessary capital.\nEnergy and raw materials are the wheels of the industry.\nLong ago, the only kind of energy conversions which we know was the muscle power. We ate plants, our body converted it to energy and plants in turn got their energy from the sun.\nHeat energy was converted into motion in the steam engine.\nIndustrial production methods leads to mechanisation of plants and animals.\nEgg-laying hens have a complex world of behavioural needs and drive but the egg industry locks the hens inside tiny coops.\nA cattle as soon as it is born is put in a cage, where a machine feeds it with nutrients, medicines and another machine milks it.\nThe cattle is soon butchered as young steaks are more tasty.\nAnimals also show social and psychological needs, which is completely ignored by modern farm industry.\nAn infant monkey showed preference for an dummy monkey resembling a real monkey mother but not providing it any material for sustenance over a monkey made of metal-wire and fittled with a milk bottle from which the infant could stuck.\nSomeone must buy the products otherwise the industrialists and investors will go bust.\nThus came a new ethic - consumerism which sees the comsumptions of ever more products and services as a positive thing.\nExcessive consumerism's effect is most clearly found in the food market as obesity.\nState and market have taken precendence over family and community.\nDuring the medieval time, when you are unwell, the community helped you.\nNow, the state and market helps us by giving health insurace and healthcare facilities.\nNation is an imagined community of the state.\nThe consumer tribe is the imagined community of the market.\nAn empires spreads to gain more natural resources.\nOver the last century, the world was the most peaceful.\nThe fatalities due to human crimes like violence and war were at their historical lowest.\nWhy?\nThe cost of war increased and peace become more lucrative.\nIf California was invaded in the past, the invader could have got its gold mines. \nBut if California is invaded now, they would gain very little for its wealth today resides in the minds of engineers, doctors, directors etc.\nMoney brings happiness only up to a point and beyond that point, it has little significance.\nFamily and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health.\nHappiness also depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective realities.\nIf you want a bullock cart and you got a bullock cart, you are content.\nBut if you want a Ferrari and you got a Fiat, you feel deprived.\nHappiness is also a part of our biological system.\nSome people are genetically programmed to be more happy than others.\nIt is in part dictated by our DNA.\nIf you have a why to live, you can almost bear any how.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/sapiens/","title":"Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/":{"body":"Passion hypothesis: figure out what you are passionate about, find a job that matches the passion and pursue it for occupational happiness.\nPassion hypothesis came up in 1970's. In 1987, a survery said 61 percent are happy with their jobs. The number went down to 45 percent by 2010. But these were the years of booming passing hypothesis.\nThe author Steven Pink finds that a job will be fulfilling if it gives you autonomy, creativity and connection to the work place. \nNote that passion does not come here.\nThe first two things come after spending years in the job, which the passion hypothesis fails.\nTo feel intrinsically motivated for your work, you should have\n\nautonomy - the feeling that you have control over your day and the your actions are important.\ncompetence - the feeling that you are good at what you do.\nrelatedness - the feeling of connection to other people. \n\nTraits that define a great job are control, impact and creativity.\nBoth of these lists does not say passion.\nThese traits are acquired by years of practice.\nThe passion mindset is wrong and potentially dangerous.\nIt leads to ambiguos questions like \"Who am I?\", \"What do I truly love?\" and the answers are hard to confirm.\nThe alternative is craftsman mindset.\nIt focuses on what you can offer to the world whereas passion mindset looks at what the world offers to you.\nCraftsman mindset offers clarity by turning your attention to becoming so good, they can't ignore you.\nSupply and demand says that the skills which make a job great are rare and valuable.\nTo have a great job, you should have rare and valuable skills.\nThese skills are a your career capital.\nThe craftsman mindset with its relentless focus on becoming \"so good, they can't ignore you\" is well-suited for acquiring career capital. \nThe craftsman mindset fails when:\n\nthe job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.\nthe job focuses on something you think is useless or bad for the world.\nthe job forces you to work with people you dislike.\n\nTo reach the elite level, you must perform deliberate practice.\nIf you just show up and work hard, you will soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better.\nDeliberate practice is stretching of skills beyond comfortable accompanied by instant feedback, so as to improve on the task and avoid plateau.\nA study of chess players revelead that players who did serious study of the game truimphed players who only improved thier skills be tournament.\nPlayers who did serious study of the game were doing deliberate practice and it improved their skills.\nFive habits of a craftsman:\n\nDecide what capital market you're in - two types of career markets: winner-take-all and auction. In winner-take-all market, there is only one type of career captial and many people competing for it. In an auction market, there are different types of captial and each person might generate a unique collection of capitals.\nIdentify your capital type - Once you have identified the market, you must define the type of captial you must want to pursue. In blogging, which is a winner-take-all market, the only capital which matters is the quality of your writing. In a auction market, there are a wide variety of skills which can be useful. Use open gates - opportunities that are already open to you and build the skills in auction market.\nDefine good - Once you have identified the skill to build, define what is good in your field.\nStretch and Destroy - Do deliberate practice to build your skill.\nBe patient - Acquiring capital takes time. 10,000 hour rule (or ten years) - the number of hours of practice required for true expertise as found by researchers.\n\nThe hardest phase is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come.\nYou develop these skills until you are too valuable to be ignored.\nControl over what you do and how you increases your happiness, engagement, and a sense of fulfillment.\nControl acquired without capital is not sustainable.\nOnly after you have demonstrated that you have the career capital, you will bid for more control (freedom).\nWhen you have gained enough capital to acquire meaningful control over your working life, your employer will resist your bid for more freedom.\nYou should only pursue a bid for more control if you have evidence that people are willing to pay you for.\nMoney is a neutral indicator of value. \nDo what people are willing to pay for.\nIf people are not willing to pay for the project, then you don't have sufficient capital in exchange for the control you desire.\nMissions give you a sense of purpose and energy to your work.\nTo identify a mission, you have to be at the cutting edge in your field.\nTo satisfy a mission, you need relevant career capital.\nBoth of the above are complementary - when you reach the cutting edge of your field, you would have acquired enough career capital to purse your mission.\nAt the cutting edge, the field of adjacent possibles becomes visible.\nTake little bets.\nLittle bets help you expore compelling ideas in the field of adjacent possible.\nFor example, to get to the cutting edge, the author (Cal Newport) gives a weekly target of mastering a academic proof and he takes little bets which are small side-projects to try out compelling ideas.\nA mission requires marketing.\nIt must be remarkable and must be launched in a venue where should remarking is made easy.\nExample: The best way to market yourself as a programmer is to create remarkable open-source software.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/","title":"So Good They Can't Ignore You"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/storyworthy/":{"body":"Three ways to collect stories:\n\nHomework for life - write a storyworthy moment - a one sentence summary or description of something storyworthy from the day.\nFirst, best, last, worst - Use a prompt (ex: car) and make note of the first car, best car, last car and worst car\nDream at the tip of your pen - take a piece of paper and pen and let your thoughts flow.

Their family motto is Qui plantavit curabit - he who has planted will preserve. By honesty and industriousness, they had amassed a comfortable fortune when Teddie was born. In this sense, he had an enormous start over other youths, whose daily bread depended on their daily efforts.\nTheodore Roosevelt (TR) was born on 27 Oct 1858. He was sick as a child - suffering from cold, coughs, fever and with a worsening asthma. Often, he was not able to sleep at night peacefully.\nIn winter 1970-71, TR's dad said to him that he has the mind but not the body. Without a body, the mind cannot go far as it should. To help him build the body, hiss dad setup a home gymnasium for Teddie to exercise. When Roosevelt found that his asthma condition did not improve, his insticnt was to increase the viguour of the exercise and he set out to practice even harder. He also took up boxing.\nEach time he suffered from an attack of asthma or cough, he recovered back with an increased vigour in his activities to compensate for the lost time.\nThe Roosevelt family went on a 377 day trip to Europe when TR was 11 years old. When he was 12, TR and his family went on an another trip to Egypt, Liverpool and Europe. He spent the summer in a German home, studying German. At this time, Teddie showed traces of determination and inspiration of a born leader.\nIn his early-teens, TR busied himself with study. He never seems to know what idleness was. Every leisure moment was filled with a reading or an activity.\nFrom his childhood, TR had a fascination for birds and nature. When he was 18, he documented the birds, insects in the localities and published his first printed work - The Summer Brids of the Adirondacks.\nWhen he lost his father, he remembered him as the person who gave him his breathe - as a sick child suffering from asthma, his father put little Teddie on his shoulders, which was a huge comfort for Teddie.\nTo prepare for Harvard, Theodore completed three years of study in two years time. He studied in Harvard where he was in the boxing club. At lectures in Harvard, he challanged statements and demanded clarifications. He was also a part of multiple clubs, participating in boxing, wrestiling, body-building. Along with this, he practiced recitations daily, attendly weekly dancing classes, hunted in the woods, and taught in a sunday school.\nTeddie had a iron self-discipline and he plotted every day with the methodism of a Wesleyan minister. The amount of time he studied each day was small - rarely more than a quater of a day but his concentration was so intense and his reading so rapid that he could afford more time off than others. The other time were packed with mental, physical or social activity.\nOn 30 June 1880, he graduate from Harvard as a B.A. magna cum laude and on Oct 27, he got married to Alice Lee Hathaway (he was 22). Theodore cherished life, for he wrote in his dairy when he graduated from Harvard My career at college has been happier and more successful than that of any man I have ever known.\nAfter Harvard, he joined Columbia Law School. Theodore started visiting Morton Hall, the headquaters of the Twenty-first District Republican Association in Fall 1880.\nIn the winter of 1880-81, he researched for the book The Naval War of 1812, making full use of the Astor Library, documenting every sentence of his manuscript. The book was a huge success at both sides of the Atlantic and a copy of it was placed upon every US Navy Vessel in 1886 by special regulation. For almost a century, it remained a definitive work in its field, for it is a serious piece of academic writing with clarity, accuracy and completeness backed by massive documentation.\nHe was nominated for the New York Assmebly when he was 23 years old and was victorious in the following election. He introduced various bills in the assembly and had the courage to accept he was wrong when he was wrong. As a politician, Rooselvelt was a Republican on State matters but independent on local and municipla affairs. He threw himself into legislative business, working upto fourteen hours a day. His speeches were so forceful that it created an instant sensation.\nIn 1884, he lost Alice Lee Hathaway and his mother on the same night. During times of pain, Roosovelt buried himself in solitude and removed the references to the past from memory. For example, all correspondance with Alice were destroyed or burnt. Theodore does not mention Alice in his Autobiography and he also did not speak about Alice to their first daughter Baby Lee.\nAfter Alice's death, Roosevelt went West, spending whole days in the saddle, riding as many as seventy-two miles between dawn and darkness. Roosevelt was a man of tremondous physical and mental energy. Theodore the hunter exulted in chasing a caribuo for thirty-six hours through the snowy forest with neither tent nor blankets to protect him. He went to the West - the Badlands to kill buffalos. For example, at six o'clock, Roosevelt mounted a horse and rided through the rain all day to hunt buffaloes and it was only at nightfall, he returned to ranch grinning.\nHe wrote the book Hunting Trips in 1885, which soon became a standard textbook of big-game hunting in the United States. He invested $85,000 in the ranches at Dakota and the bad winter of 1886-87 caused loss of cattles and much of the investment. Though the investment impoverished him, in the Badlands, he built a massive body, repaired his soul and learned to live on equal times with men poorer and rougher than himself.\nRoosevelt married his childhood friend, Edith Carrow in 1886. He read to her before sleep, rowed her and they went to picnic. Sex to Theodore was part of the mystical union of marriage and its function was only to procreate. Outside of marriage, it did not exist.\nRoosevelt ran for New York mayor in 1886. Fighting is fun for him, win or lose and this characteristic of him made him many friends as anything else. He suffered defeat in that election.\nIn 1887, the flora and fauna of Badlands were facing destruction. Roosevelt formed the Boone &amp; Crockett Club, an association to promote preservation of large game of the country, observing and recording natural history of wild animals, preservation of forest regions with him as the president. The club lobbied for the Forest Reserve Act, which Roosevelt used as a president to sign millions of green acres into perpetuity.\nThe instinct of born author - the compulsion to write was strong in him. Theodore's habit in moments of joy or sorrow has been to reach for the pen. During his lifetime, Roosevelt wrote 38 books. The other writing of him is The Winning of the West which documented the history of the spread of the United States across the American continent. It was a success on both sides of the Atlantic. His style of writing in this book was simple, naturl and picturesque with a detailed research.\nNext, he became a Civil Service Commissioner and moved to Washington. At Washington, he dined out at least five times a week, and he and Edith hosted a calculated list of guests to maintain the right admixture of power, brains and breeding. He was also a guest at the salon of Henry Adams and John Hay, where rich and talented people crowded. Roosevelt was equally at home on Adam's salon, the Senate or the cowboy cabin.\nHe was the President of the New York City Police board. He went on night patrols, maintained law and order. Roosevelt was the dominant person in the room and acted as a press spokesman for the entire board. He had a habit of inviting reporters to spend the day in his big, bare office.\nAs an Assistant Secretary of the Navy, he made the US Navy reach its peak of preparedness for fighting and efficiency which was never seen before. He chose as his theme a maxim by George Washington: \"To be  prepared for war is the most effectual means to promote peace.\" He had cultivated an insane amount of ability to work under pressure with a clarity, analyse the data and make clear decisions.\nRoosevelt preached to fight when a battle came. When the Spanish American war broke out in 1898 at Cuba, he joined the army as a Lieutant Colonel, acting upon his preachings when the occasion has arisen. He led the volunteer troop, known as The Rough Riders. The troop successfully capture San Juan Heights, a strategic point in Cuba which was a decisive point in the victory of United States in the war. To this end, Roosevelt led the troop with an inhuman energy through the dense jungles of Cuba, charging up the hills and driving the Spanish away. He was promoted as Colonel during the war.\nRoosevelt also took reporters with him to the war, as he relied upon them to glorify him as a warrior and cultivated them accordingly. During his public carrier, TR cultivate a great relationship with the reporters, offering them first-hand insights.\nRoosevelt become the Governor of New York in 1899.\nHe campaigned for vice-presidency and the following is a timetable of one undated compaign day for his vice-presidency:\n7:00 am Breakfast, 7:30 am A speech, 8:00 am Reading a historical work,  9:00 am A speech,  10:00 am Dictating letters,  11:00 am Discussing montana mines,  11:30 am A speech,  12:00 Reading an ornithological work,  12:30 pm A speech,  1:00 pm Lunch,  1:30 pm A speech,  2:30 pm Reading Sir Walter Scott,  3:00 pm Answering telegrams,  3:45 pm A speech,  4:00 pm Meeting the press,  4:30 pm Reading,  5:00 pm A speech,  6:00 pm Reading,  7:00 pm Supper,  8-10 pm Speaking,  11:00 pm Reading alone in this car,  12:00 To bed.\nDuring the summers when various cousins comes to stay at Sagamore Hill (his house at Oyster Bay, New York), he plays with them - chasing and crawling through the tunnels in hay-barn in pursuit of squealing boys and girls.

He enjoyed being the president of United States, delighted in every aspect of his job - plowing through mountains of documents, leaving his desk bare by lunchtime, matching with swith scholars etc. He left a photographic impression upon the people he met.\nTheodore was more than satisfied that he is an American, free born and free bred and acknowledged that no man is superioir except for his own worth or as inferior, except for his own demerit. He said \"No man has had a happier life than I have led; a happier life in every way.\"\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/the-rise-of-theodore-roosevelt/","title":"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/think-again/":{"body":"We hesitate at the idea of rethinking.\nPart of the problem is cognitive laziness.\nThe other part of the problem is when we rethink, it makes the world more unpredictable.\nIt requires us to admit that what was once right may now be wrong and reconsidering something that we believe in deeply threaten our identities, making us feel like losing a part of ourselves.\nAs we think and talk, we often slip into mindset of three different professions:\n\nthe prosecutor when we criticize others's reasoning, marshaling arguments to prove them wrong and win our case.\nthe preacher when we preach to others, defending our values and promoting our ideals.\nthe politician when we seek to win the approval of others.\n\nBut the ideal mode of thinking is like a scientist - the mind being open to rethink and question the assumptions and beliefs in search of truth as we sought new evidence and experiment with new ideas instead of outright rejection or acceptance. It requires being actively open-minded, searching for reasons why we might be wrong and revising our views based on what we learn.\nRethinking as a part of Life\nImpostor syndrome is having low confidence but high competence.\nIn a study, people with impostor syndrome tend to perform better than others as they are more open to changing their beliefs.\nWith impostor syndrom adding doubt to their abilities, the obstacle allows them to learn more and motivates them to work smarter (though a chronic feeling of being impostor breeds misery, crush motivation and hold them back from pursuing their ambitions.)\nThe opposite of impostor syndrome is armchair quaterback syndrome.\nArmchair quaterback syndrome is where the football fans claim to know more than the coach.\nThey have high confidence but low competence and they are less open to rethinking and filling the gaps in their knowledge.\nMaking a long list of areas where we're ignorant helps to recognize our shortcomings and open doors to doubt.\nThe doubt helps us to search for new answers and to improve our knowledge.\nBy acknowledging what we don't know, we can pay more attention to strong evidence and reading materials that contradicts our opinions to build better knowledge.\nAlways question your assumptions, be open to new evidence and to update your beliefs if the new evidence proves beneficial.\nWhen you form an opinion, ask yourself what should happen to prove it false and what conditions should be satisfied for it to hold true.\nThen, keep track of your views so you can see when you were right, when you were wrong and how your thinking has evolved.\nSetup a challenge network.\nA challenge network helps you to challenge your existing beliefs and opinion and allows you to rethink them by bringing in new perspectives.\nAgreeable people make for a great support but they don't disagree nor challenge our beliefs.\nThe ideal members of challenge network are disagreeable people.\nThe are fearless about questioning the way things have always been done.\nWith a challenge network, you can debate and broaden your thinking.\nWhen people say you are wrong, some people take fight-or-flight response, while some are open to update their ideas and their perspectives. \nBy discovering we are wrong, we are being less-wrong.\nTo accept being wrong, we should not be attached to our ideas.\nInterpersonal Rethinking\nWhen we are trying to open other people's mind, we can accomplish more by listening than by talking.\nExpert negotiatiors listened more and shared their feelings more often.\nIn negotiations, they worked towards finding a common ground first and then starting from there to support their case.\nThey presented fewer reasons (one or two strong points) to support their case as too many arguments dilute the power of each and every one. \nThey opened others mind for thinking by asking more questions on the holden assumptions.\nWe assume that there are only two views in an issue but reality is more complicated.\nIn an experiment, participants were asked to discuss on divisive topics, like abortion laws in pairs and asked to come up with a joint agreement.\nBefore the experiment, one set of participants read an article on gun control where the problem was presented as a bipartisan problem and the other set read an article were the problem was presented with multiple views.\nThe pair who read the article with multiple views came into a joint conclusion 100 percent of the time but the participants who read the bipartisan version of the article came into a joint agreement only 46 percent of the times.\nAdding a dose of complexity can disrupt overconfidence cycles and spur rethinking cycles.\nWhen people ignore advice, it isn't always because they disagree with it. Sometimes they're resisting the sense of pressure and feeling that someone else is controlling their life.\nAsking people to vaccinate their children does not work.\nHere comes the vaccine whisperers.\nThey ask questions to mothers who did not vaccinate their children.\nThe whisperes listened to their story with curiosity and humility, without any hidden motive.\nAt the end of the conversation, they affirmed to the parents that taking a vaccine is their choice.\nWhen left with this, the parents vaccinated their children.\nThis is motivational interviewing at work.\nIn motivational interviewing, you start with an attitude of humility and curiosity. You ask genuine open-ended questions, engage in reflective listening and affirming the person's desire and ability to change.\nThe key here is listening your way through the desire and ability to change of the other.\nPeople can sense easily when the questions are tactical and when they sense it, they will put up their defense shields.\nA black man persuaded white supremacists to quit the Ku Klax Klan. \nHow did he do it?\nHe asked the clan members questions, inducing conterfactual thinking to debunk the stereotypes they held against black people.\nIn counterfacutal thinking, making people think the other scenario, like, how would their life have been different be if they have been in poverty or born as a Asian can help people to open their minds.\nPeople have prejudices, animosity, stereotypes towards other groups.\nOnce we have formed stereotypes, for both mental and social reasons it's hard to undo them.\nSocially, we tend to interact with people who share them, which makes them even more extreme.\nFor example, Red Sox fans hate Yankees as they grow up in a family of Red Sox fans.\nReflecting on the arbitary reasons of animosity, points where we (the groups) disagree on trivalities can help in opening our mind and in activating the rethinking cycle. \nIf you find yourself saying ______ is always good or ______ is always bad, you may be a member of idea cult.\nPeople have binary bias - it helps our brain to simplify things as black and white.\nBut the world is more complex.\nHaving a dose of complexity can reduce these overconfidence.\nKnowledge evolves.\nThe worst think about best practices is that we preache its virtues, it gets frozen in time and we stop questioning its vices.\nWe should have a constant search for better practices.\nRon was a public-elementary-school teacher in rural Massachusetts.\nHe begins a school year by presenting students with problems to work through in individual phases.\nThe approach works like this: first, kids work individually, update their ideas in small groups, present their thoughts to the class and arrive at final solution together.\nThis way, children identified problems in their work, developed hypothesis and designed their own experiments to test their knowledge.\nWhen children are confused, Ron embraces that confusion with curiosity and interest, inculcating rethinking in children.\nIn a study, though students mentioned they liked lecture more than active learning, it is in the active learning session they learnt more.\nBecause active learning gives the opportunity to question the information and participate in rethinking, helping in developing tools needed in life.\nTeams which had psychological safety made fewer errors.\nPsychological safety is about fostering a climate of respect, trust and openness in which people can raise concerns and suggestions without fear of reprisal.\nIt is not about relaxing standard, being nice and agreeable, or giving unconditional praise. \nHow do you know? - a powerful question expressing doubt and curiosity with a confident humility, allowing us to rethink situations at work places. Ask it often at critical junctures.\nCareer checkup question: to activate rethinking cycles in your career, ask yourself Have I reached a learning plateau in my role or workplace, and is it time to consider a pivot?\nFrom an early age, we have visions - this is what I want to do in future but having a vision blind us to alternative possibilities. \nScheduling rethinking dates twice a year in the calendar helps us to rethink our choices periodically.\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/book-notes/think-again/","title":"Think Again"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/musings/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/musings/","title":"Musings"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/musings/dfs-farewell/":{"body":"I first interacted with Dr. Bharath Ramsundar when I invited him for a machine learning paper reading group which I organised at PSG College of Technology. \nIt was 2020 and institutions were closed due to the COVID-pandemic.\nHe is one of the rare people who are kind-enough to share their time and knowledge with others.\nThe seminar took place on Oct 31st, 2020 where he introduced the DeepChem project (the slides of the talk which he shared with us after the talk can be found here).\nSoon after, I completed my college in May 2021 and joined IIT-Madras as a project assistant.\nMy work at IIT-M was remote and it was during this time that I started contributing to the open-source project DeepChem, interested mainly by deep learning, chemistry (one of my favorite subject in high school) and the community -

I learnt a little bit of many domains - backend development, CI/CD, infrastructure orchestration, frontend dev, machine learning, cloud services etc.\nLastly, my ears also got tuned to American English.\nThere used to be a one-on-one call between me and Dr. Ramsundar every day during the first few months, in which we designed the core machine-learning platform for Deep Forest Sciences (the work resulted in a patent application).\nThe experience provided me with confidence as I had a lingering doubt over my skills.\nWhen I had self-doubt on my skills, the work here was a source evidence -

translate Python documentation to tamil.\nThe reason I wanted to do this project was:\n\n\nEnglish is a language barrier for entering into tech by non-native speakers of the language.\nI grew up speaking Tamil and one book which accompanied me since I was 8 years old was Oxford English Mini Dictionary.\nI had a hard copy of it and still continue to have it in my desk.\n\n\nThere were technical terms, like ephemeral port, heuristic and without knowing the meaning of these words, I was not able to understand the core concept or what ephemeral ports do.\n\n\nThere are tech tutorials in YouTube in native languages but they lack the depth which is required to develop good software.\n\n\nI thought let's experiment with a smaller project - converting FastAPI documentation to Tamil and so I took on the project in October 2022. I gave myself an agenda of converting first 3 pages of fastapi documentation to tamil by Oct 31, 2022.\nThe first weekend of October, I went to the district library where I got a dicitonary of english-tamil translations of technical terms and made a copy of important terms, like framework etc. Then, I started docs translation.\nSome of the challenges which I faced were:\n\nTranslation required high bandwidth than I expected.\nSome of the technical terms did not have a good tamil translation.\nThe process of typing tamil words in english keypad was very slow. For example, completing a single sentence often took about 5 mins for me.\n\nI realised that I will not able to allocate the required bandwidth for translating the docs due to other commitments and I moved the project to my todo list. Meanwhile, if you are interested in translation, here are some helpers:\n\nSome of the translation words for which I made a digital copy are available here.\nCheckout the discussion here in fastapi forums.\nA pull request of docs translation requires two reviewers.

Money spent on perpetual financial incentives can be put on education, infrastructure, etc which can help people in the longer run.\nDemocracy\nPeople claim democracy is great but I have some questions over it. Politicians in\na democracy needs to face approvals from population every 5 years or so.

A kilo of rice takes about 4500 liters of waters. Agriculture creates a stress on water table. Will not moving away from eating rice make it better?

I developed and tutored a summer course on statistics, introducing kids to essential statistical methods like data collection, summary statistics and spreadsheet skills.\nEducation at Mango was activity based learning. For each course objective, a handout outlining an activity that led to achieving the objective was prepared. The children worked on the activities, and the classes revolved around discussing these activities and their connection to the learning objectives. These sessions served as a platform for the children to refine their ideas and knowledge through interactive discussions, comparing their work with others', rethinking concepts, and polishing their understanding. Most activities centered around statistics related to sports or cartoons, as we believed these topics resonated more effectively with the children and engaged them more than other subjects.\nTo give an example, the first course objective focused on data collection. The handout introduced basic survey methods like forms and telephone interviews, then tasked the children with gathering information using notepads. Next, the activity was discussed in class and the children were taught about the drawbacks of using notepad for information collection, how to organize the information in a spreadsheet. Next, to introduce concepts like mean and median, we piqued their curiosity by posing questions based on the data, then demonstrated how summary statistics could be used to answer such questions.

Hence it becomes difficult to detect malware from the payload when the malware is communicating via a TLS connection. When a client application establishes connection with it's server, the client application does so by performing TLS handshakes with the server. This communication is not encrypted and it can help in detecting malware since it provides us with a set of observable features.\nTo intiate communication via TLS, the client application first sends a client hello packet for which the server responds with a server hello packet. In a client hello packet, the client sends the supported TLS versions, an ordered list of offered ciphersuites, compression methods and additional parameters like supported elliptic curves and signature algorithms. The fingerprint of a client hello packet is constructed by concatenating the above mentioned field values to form a string seperated by a delimitter and computing the strings SHA-512 hash value. The server responds to the client hello with a server hello packet containing the following fields of interest for fingerprinting: the selected TLS protocol version, the selected cipher suite and compression method and a list of extensions. The server chooses the ciphersuite of highest preference which it can satisfy.\nDetecting malware from TLS fingerprints\nThe following are few methods which can be utilized for detecting malware from TLS Fingerprint string.\nUsing a fingerprint database to detect client application\nEvery client application has a TLS fingerprint associated with it. A fingerprint database of known fingerprint and the associated process can be collected to detect the process associated with the fingerprint. A connection is suspicious when an unknown fingerprint is encountered. Cisco provides an open database of the fingerprints and the process as part of their tool mercury.\nBenign applications (like traffic from an enterprise network) update their application regulary and use the latest security features and protocols. For example, most of the benign applications use the latest version of Firefox browser but malwares use older version of Firefox browser. Malwares make advantage of an bug or security loophole in the older version of the application. A fingerprint associated with an older application process can signal a presence of malicious activity.\nClassifier based approach\nMalware applications sometimes use older version of security protocols and the ciphersuites offered by them differ from the ciphersuites offered by benign applications. Similarly, the encryption algorithm, the advertised TLS extension can help in building feature set for a classifier model based on machine learning techniques like logistic regression or random forest to detect malware from the client hello packet. Such a technique has been used in Anderson et al, 2018..\nDrawbacks\nA significant drawback of using the fingerprint based approach is the high number of false positives it generates. A fingerprint can match to more than one process and in that case, it will be difficult to detect the process which has generated the fingerprint. For example, Abuse.ch reports a set of fingerprints which belongs to malwares but also cautions that these fingerprints might also match benign process.\nWhile each browser, TLS library or a product produces a unique client hello fingerprint, the parameters used by the application is not statically defined. For example, browsers alter their behavior based on hardware support, operating system or user preferences. Browsers also allow users to disable cipher suites. Some browsers like Chrome changes their behavior depending on the hardware support. For example, chrome prioritizes ChaCha20 cipher on devices which lacks AES hardware acceleration. These optimizations can result in several valid ciphers and extensions for the same version of an application making them difficult to fingerprint.\nIn the paper Anderson et al, 2020, the knowledge of processes which produce a fingerprint and destination context in which the fingerprint is observed is used to find the process generating the fingerprint using a naive bayes classifier. A caveat here is that the detection approach depends on the fingerprint database. It involves regular updation of fingerprint database to detect process accurately which may not be possible in all network settings.\nOne may wonder why client fingerprints are used rather than the server fingerprints. The use of server fingerprints also suffers from the problem of falsepositives. Moreover, a server application may choose a random ciphersuite instead of the highest preference ciphersuite offered by the client. By this way, a malicious server can evade being detected.\nReferences\n\nTLS fingerprinting with JA3 and JA3S\nThis site has a good overview of an TLS connection.\nAnderson, B., Paul, S., and McGrew, D.

The capture process using libpcap for high speed network traffic is very \ninefficient because of the following reasons:\n\n\nDuring packet capture, if the packets are delivered as soon as they arrive, the application\ncapturing packets will be woken up for each packet and might have to make one or more calls to\nthe operating system to fetch each packet. If instead packets are not delivered as soon as they\narrive but are accumulated in a buffer and delivered after a short delay, the CPU overhead could be \nreduced since each system call delivers multiple packet. Packets that arrive are stored in a buffer and\nonly on some platforms the buffer size could be set. If the buffer size is too small and too many packets \nare being captured, pcakets could be dropped if the buffer fills up before the application \nread the packets. PACKET_MMAP (the packet memory map technique) allows user to set \ntheir own buffer size resulting in more efficient capture.\n\n\nThe second reason is that packets are received in kernel space and process runs in \nuser space. All the user analysis are done in the user space. Once the kernel receives a \npacket from the network interface, it then looks for process which are requiring the packet and\ndelivers the packet to that process. This approach is highly inefficient to capture high speed traffic \nbecause too much CPU time will be consumed in the heavy I/O operations. By using a shared buffer\nbetween the kernel and user space (memory mapped region), one can minimize copying of \npackets from kernel space to user space. Reading process just needs to wait for the \npackets to be written in the shared ring buffers.\n\n\nThe Ring Buffer Structure\nA ring buffer contains many blocks onto which the packets are written. Each block is a \ncontinuous region of physical memory. A block contains many frames. Block sizes are always \nmultiple of frame sizes. A frame is the smallest unit. A frame contains two parts - tpacket_hdr, \ndata buffer. The tpacket_hdr is a struct which contains details \nabout the packet and the status of this frame. It contains meta information about the \npacket like timestamp, snaplen of capture and most importantly, the offset to next packet header. \nIt is defined in the header file linux/if_packet.h\nThe data buffer is what which actually contains the packet that is sent over the network interface. \nMemory Mapping and using circular ring buffer\nMapping is done by calling the conventional mmap function. The socket is configured\nto write the packets in a memory mapped ring buffer. Once the set up\nis ready, the user reads packets from the memory mapped buffer. This helps in \navoiding packet copies and reducing the number of system calls for accessing the packets.\nThe user reads the packets block wise. Once the packet starts\narriving into the ring, the user can either continously keep checking for new packets\nor leave the work to operating system by using poll() utility. \nTPACKET_V3\nRing buffer associated with the socket can have three configurations using the setsockopt() function.\nA socket can have be of any of the three TPACKET versions. Version 1 is the default ring buffer version. \nA few advantages of using TPACKET_V3 is that polling works on a per block basis instead of per ring basis as in the earlier\nversion. It is said that TPACKET_V3 utilizes 15 - 20% less CPU usage and has a higher packet capture rate.\nFor more details about other versions, one can read about them here\nSetting up Packet Capture Interface\nThese are the main steps in setting up the capture process:\n- Create a socket \n- Allocate circular ring buffer\n- Memory map the allocatd ring buffer to user process\n- Wait for incoming packets and capture them\n- Process the packets as your requirements\n- Close the capture socket and deallocate all resources\nSockets are created using the socket() utility. We create an AF_PACKET socket.\nOnce a socket it created, we set the TPACKET version as 3. The ring buffer is set using\na call to setsockopt() function with the option PACKET_RX_RING and ring properties.\nOnce the socket and the ring buffer is setup, we create a memory mapped region\nwith the socket file descriptor and ring size as input arguments. The ring size is the\nnumber of blocks in the ring multiplied by size of block. These values are configurable. \nThe socket is then binded to an interface and in case we are using multiple sockets for\ncapture, we can use PACKET_FANOUT option to distributed packets across sockets.\nThe kernel initializes all blocks to TP_STATUS_KERNEL. It keeps a pointer\nto one of the blocks in the ring buffer (Starting at 0) and when the kernel\nreceives a packet it puts it in the buffer and updates the status with\nat least the TP_STATUS_USER flag. Then the user can read the packet and\nonce the packet is read the user must reset the status fields to \nTP_STATUS_KERNEL, so the kernel can again use that frame buffer. The kernel fills a block, \nand it increments (modulo the number of block) the block pointer.\nTo check for new packets, the user can use the poll() function which takes in the\nsocket file descriptor (everything is a file in UNIX) and returns true when there are new\npackets. Otherwise, the user could also use their own implementation to check for new\npackets in the socket. \nAn implementation of the packet capture technique can be found here\nReferences\n\nKernel Doc on Packet MMAP\n\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/posts/packet-capture-mmap/","title":"High Speed Packet Capture Using Packet MMAP technique"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/posts/python-class-creation/":{"body":"In python, all classes are an instance of an other class.\nAn user-defined class is an instance of type class.\nclass Foo:\n    \n    def __init__(self, a):\n        self.a = a \n\n    def get_a(self):\n        return self.a\n\n    def set_a(self, a):\n        self.a = a\n\nFor the above class Foo, print (type(Foo)) shows &lt;class 'type'&gt;.\nThe class keyword creates an instance of type object which can be identified using Foo.\nA class object also allows to makes instances of it's type by using its identifier (Foo).\nHere is an another way to create a class object by directly creating an instance of type class.\n\ndef get_a(arg1):\n    return arg1.a\n\ndef set_a(arg1, i):\n    arg1.a = i\n\ndef __init__(arg1, a):\n    arg1.a = a\n\nFoo = type('Foo', (), dict(get_a=get_a, set_a=set_a, \n          __init__=__init__))\n\nHere, we directly invoke type() constructor to create the class object.\nThe type() constructor has the signature type(name, bases, namespace).\nname is a string giving the name of the class to be constructed, bases is a tuple which identifies the parent classes of the class to be constructed and namespace is a dictionary of attributes and methods of the class to be constructed.\nCustomising class creation\nUsing __new__ method\n__new__ can be used to control creation of object.\nFor example, to implement a singleton object, we can use __new__.\nHere is another example of using __new__ object:\nclass Number(tuple):\n\n    def __new__(cls, *args):\n        if not isinstance(args[0], int):\n            raise ValueError('argument should be an integer')\n\n        if (args[0] % 2 == 0):\n            return tuple.__new__(tuple, (args[0], 'even'))\n        elif (args[0] % 2 == 1):\n            return tuple.__new__(tuple, (args[0], 'odd'))\n\na = Number(1)  # `a` stores (1, 'odd')\nb = Number(2)  # `b` stores (2, 'even')\n\nIn the above example, we customise the creation of a tuple.\nThe __new__ method is used to customise the creation of tuple since once a tuple is created, it cannot be modified.\n__new__ creates a new instance of the class.\nThe __new__ method is the different from __init__.\nIt creates the actual class object while the __init__ method customizes the created object.\nCustomising via metaclass\nThe class of a class is knows as metaclass.\nMost classes have type as their metaclass as type is the class which is used to create the class.\nWe can customise class creation by using the metaclass keyword in class definition or by inheriting from an existing class that included such argument.\nA metaclass can customise preparation of class namespace and resolving of method resolution order.\nExample\nclass Meta(type):\n    pass\n\nclass Foo(metaclass=Meta):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print ('type of Foo is ', type(Foo))  # shows `&lt;class '__main__.Meta'&gt;`\n    print ('type of Meta is ', type(Meta))  # shows `&lt;class 'type'&gt;`.\n\nThe above snippet shows &lt;class '__main__.Meta'&gt;

\"a=\" &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; \"element size = \" &lt;&lt; c10::elementSize(a.type()) &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n\n  // Converting scalar to primitive c++ type\n  auto b = a.to&lt;float&gt;();\n  auto c = a.toDouble();\n\nTensorIterator\nGiven an input tensor and output tensor, TensorIterator can be used for iterating over the tensors to perform pointwise operations on them. The TensorIterator also provides additional functionalities like shape broadcasting, type promotion which saves a lot of trouble by automatically handling edge cases.\nIn the below example, I would like to show an example of TensorIterator.\nThough this is not the best way to use it, it helps for pedagogical purpose.\n  torch::Tensor x = torch::ones({2, 3});\n  // TensorIterator automatically handles broadcasting\n  auto y = torch::randn({3});\n  auto output = torch::empty_like(x);\n  // A TensorIteratorConfig is used to create a TensorIterator.\n  auto iter = torch::TensorIteratorConfig()\n                    .add_output(output)\n                    .add_input(x)\n                    .add_input(y)\n                    .build();\n\n  iter.for_each([&amp;](char** data, const int64_t* strides, int64_t n) {\n    for(int i=0; i&lt;n; i++) {\n      float* out_data = reinterpret_cast&lt;float*&gt;(data[0] + strides[0] * i);\n      float* in_data_x = reinterpret_cast&lt;float*&gt;(data[1] + strides[1] * i);\n      float* in_data_y = reinterpret_cast&lt;float*&gt;(data[2] + strides[2] * i);\n      *out_data = *in_data_x + *in_data_y;\n    }\n  });\n\nTo build a TensorIterator, we use TensorIteratorConfig to specify the input and output tensors along with other additional configurations and then call TensorIteratorConfig::build to create the TensorIterator.\nTensorIterator provides the for_each function which can be used to iterate over the tensors in the iterator.\nThe for_each method accepts a loop with a signature of (char** data, const int64_t* strides, int64_t n).\nThe first argument char** data contains a char* pointer for each of the tensor in tensor iterator.\nHaving it as char* allows us to represent the underlying data as an array of bytes which can be reinterpreted to any other data type.\nIn this case, we are reinterpreting the underlying bytes as float.\nThe next argument, strides specify, for each of the tensor in tensor iterator, how much bytes should we move to access the next element.\nThough tensors are multidimensional, they are represented in memory as a contiguous 1-D array.\nThe stride of a tensor says how many bytes we have to move to reach the next element along that axis.\nLastly, the argument n specifies the number of elements in the tensor.\nThe for-loop iterates over the memory location of the output and two input tensors stored in data[0], data[1], data[2] with a step size of strides[0], strides[1], strides[2] respectively.\nAt each location, it reinterprets the bytes as a float and performs the pointwise operation of addition here.\nA working example of the above can be found here.\nFor more details about TensorIterator, I refer the readers to this blog post and to this pytorch-dev podcast by ezyang. The TensorIteratorConfig class is defined in TensorIterator.h and the struct TensorIterator is defined here.\nIn case you have any comments, questions, I would be glad to hear them.

Anomalies can be broadly classified into two types: Point anomalies where the anomaly is a single point and Collective Anomaly where the anomaly is a sequence of points. There are other types like the Contextual Anomaly where a data point is supposes to be normal but unusual due to the time when the signal is observed.\nThere are various ways to detect anomalies in time series data like proximity based methods (data points which are over a distant from the other non-anamlous data points), prediction based methods (predicts the expected value of a point and the point is labelled as anomalous if there is high deviation from the actual value ex: ARIMA), reconstruction-based methods (maps the data point to a latent space, reconstructs it and detect anomalies by finding reconstruction error). In this paper, the problem of anomaly detection is framed as an unsupervised learning problem and a Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN) framework is proposed to detect anomalies from the time series data.\nData Preprocessing\nSteps in preprocessing:\n\nProduce equally spaced time series sequence.\nImpute the missing values.\nMin-max scale the signals between -1 and +1.\nRoll the signal into windows of size 100. Hence, the dimension of input domain will be 100 X 1.\n\nModel Architecture\nThere are four key components in the architecture of the model. They are an encoder, decoder, critic X, critic Z.\n\nEncoder: The role of the encoder &amp;#8496 is to learn a mapping between the input domain and the latent domain. The rolled signals acts as input to the model and they are mapped into a latent space of dimension 20. The encoder learns the mapping between input space to latent space. The encoder is a 1-layer bi-directional LSTM with 100 hidden units.\nDecoder: The decoder learns the mapping between the latent space to the input domain. It learns how to reconstruct a signal given the signal in lower dimension. The decoder or the generator (it generates the signal from the random noise) is a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM with 64 hidden units.\nCritic X (Discriminator X): Critic X is trained to distinguish between the real signal and fake signal. It uses Wasserstein loss function for learning to distinguish between real and fake signals. Fake signals are signals which are samples from noise.\nCritic Z (Discriminator Z) - Critic Z is trained to distinguish between the random noise from the latent domain and encoded samples. Critic Z also uses wasserstein loss function during training. Both the critics are 1-D convolutional layers.\n\nTraining Procedure\nLoss functions\nGANs are zero-sum games. The direction of gradient update of the generator is opposite to the direction of gradient update of the discriminator. Generator here refers to the encoder-decoder architecture and discriminator refers to critic X and critic Z. The loss function for the generator is the sum of reconstruction error loss and the wasserstein loss. The wasserstein loss aims to maximize the distance between the real samples distributions and fake sample distribution. Let's consider the encoder. The encoder encodes the real samples from the time series. It also encodes random noise samples from the space of input domain. The role of critic X is to distinguish between the encoded real samples and noise samples. Hence, the desired learning for critic X is to produce a high score for real samples and a low score for fake samples. Critic X has to maximize the wasserstein distance between the real samples and fake samples. Hence, the critic X updates its gradient in the direction which maximizes the wasserstein distance. The role of encoder is to make a good mapping between input space and latent space i.e to reduce wasserstein loss.Hence it updates the gradients in the the direction opposite to the wasserstein distance. The decoder follows the similar procedure except it uses wasserstein loss from Critic Z. The reconstruction error for the time series data is found using the method of dynamic time warping.\nThe model is trained on one specific dataset for 2000 epochs with a batch size of 64. In an epoch, the encoder-decoder are iterated through the dataset once and the critic x and critic z are iterated through the dataset ncritic where ncritic is chosen as 5. The training process juggles between the training of discrinimator and the generator. The discriminator tries to figure out how to distinguish real data from fake and it has to learn to recognize generator's flaws. The learning of discriminator is more important because if the discriminator can't tell the difference between real and fake samples, the traning of generator fails. Hence, the discriminator is iterated 5 time through the dataset for every 1 iteration of the dataset through the generator in an epoch. In the training process, gradient penalty loss is also used. In gradient penalty, we penalize the norm of the gradient of the critic with respect to the input which adds more stability to the training.\nAnomaly Detection\nThe encoder and decoder maps the signal from input space to latent space and reconstructs the signal from latent space to input space respectively. This mapping helps in anomaly detection. For an anomalous point, thepoint is first encoded into latent space and the encoded anomalous point will deviate from the distribution of encoding of non-anomalous points. Encoding of the anomalous point maps it to the noise distribution and hence when we decode the encoded anomalous point, a high reconstruction error will be observed which can be used to detect anomalies.The critic X helps in distinguishing between the real samples and fake samples. It produces a high score for real samples and low score for fake and anomalous samples. Anomalies are detected using the reconstruction error and critic score. An anomalous point will have high reconstruction error and low critic score. We consider the anomaly score to be the product of reconstruction error and inverse of critic score. Anomalous points are points which will be having high anomaly scores. These points can be detected by considering a moving window and points exceeding 3 standard deviation from the mean and standard deviation of that window.\nReferences\n\nTadGAN\nWasserstein GAN\nImproved training of WGAN with Gradient Penalty Loss\nDynamic Time Warping\n\n","id":"https://www.arunppsg.in/posts/tadgan/","title":"Time series anomaly detection using Generative Adversarial Nets"},"https://www.arunppsg.in/projects/":{"body":"Workshop Paper\n\nOpen Source Infrastructure for Differentiable Density Functional Theory, Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling, ICML 2023 Workshop, Advika Vidhyadhiraja, Arun Pa Thiagarajan, Shang Zhu, Venkat Viswanathan, Bharath Ramsundar.\n\nPoster\n\nPotential Biases in Using Machine Learning for Healthcare Applications, RBC-FCAI Deployable AI, 2022, Arun Pa Thiagarajan.\n\nUnpublished Manuscript\n\nData-Driven Analysis of Food Corporation of India’s Operations and Recommendations, Communications of the ACM Regional Section on India Region, Arun Pa Thiagarajan, Nehal Muthukumar, Shamshu Dharwez Saganvali.\n\nOpen Source\n\nDeepChem -
