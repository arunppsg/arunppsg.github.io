# Learning Kannada
It has been almost an year now since I moved to Bengaluru last July and I managed to learn only a few words in Kannada. 
I bought the book [Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/book/), read it, loaded kannada alphabets to Anki and memorizing them.

# Memorizing Thirukkurals

This is something which I wanted to do since childhool - learn kurals and memorize them.
Now that I am powered with Anki, I am adding kurals as Anki flashcards and reading them.

(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page and you should make one too.)
