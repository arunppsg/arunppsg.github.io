My work can be described as a cross between the works of a [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/), and [Sebastián Ramírez](https://tiangolo.com/) as I work on building AI applications in Python.

### Open Source
- I worked on a [patch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/125601) on adding support for `torch.put_along_dim` in PyTorch, came across an [issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26553) in NumPy on `numpy.put_along_axis` and made a [fix](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26597) for it.
