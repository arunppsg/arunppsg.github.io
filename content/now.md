# Selling Cycle and Fractional Gym Plates
I am selling a couple of items which I have not used in this year nor planning to use in the coming year.

1. Montra Mach City Munich Single Speed cycle - lightweight, steel frame, easy maintenance, long lasting and no damage.

    - Frame size: 19T, Tyres: 700c Nylon Tyres ([pic1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r9qCTfFgAuc9P856b-4_v5-OHrNtIH3p/view?usp=sharing), [pic2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RgoNmmYhuExMTMt3e5lYdCpiK0pQjAM0/view?usp=sharing), [pic3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNUGEbnajjyxiEOY8wO9WXo3n_XXqVEQ/view?usp=sharing))
    - Price: Rs. 7,230 (original cost: Rs. 12, 000)
    - Fun fact: Actor Vijay rode a similar cycle to cast his vote in 2021 TN assembly election.
    - Offer lasts till Jan 17, 2026


2. Pair of 1.25 kg Fractional plates ([pic1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LVmC4nzncuAFtblh0wzlvkut1Xt3dq3S/view?usp=sharing), [pic2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tC_UEyZCKyN6QlTfrg0uw7yHm39i3z2/view?usp=sharing))

    - Many gym owners have plates of 2.5kg and upwards but not fractional plates. Fractional plates of 1.25 kg help in progressive overload as you increment 2.5kg in a workout instead of 5kg in hard exercises like squats, bench press, over head press. They are the most useful equipment for incremental workouts and strength training like [stronglifts program](https://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5/).

    - The product is minimally used, good condition and it lasts.

    - Price: Rs. 730 (Original cost: Rs. 1500)

In case you are interested in any of the above two, write to me at <a href="mailto:mcgusty1k@gmail.com">mcgusty1k@gmail.com</a>. I live in JP Nagar, Bangalore.


# Time Value of Money

Money loses value over time. I built a calculator to calculate how much value money loses over time - check it out [here](https://arunppsg.in/money-value/).
# Memorizing Thirukkurals

This is something which I wanted to do since childhood - learn kurals and memorize them.
Now that I am powered with Anki, I am adding kurals as Anki flashcards and reading them.

# Go Lang

Learning Go language.

# Standardizing Insurance for Products

I bought a new phone and the salesman asked me to buy accidental insurance but I ignored, despite past evidence of dropping phone.
I also avoided putting in a temper glass or covers for the phone as it will not give good aesthetics.
On the second week of new phone, I dropped the phone and the screen shattered. Now, the cost to repair it is ~40% of the phone.
Two main lessons from this:
- Anything which can break will eventually break.
- Spend 10-20% additional cost to protect the item on top of purchase cost of the item
