My resume can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arunppsg/resume/master/pdf/resume.pdf), open source work in my Github [profile](https://github.com/arunppsg). My work can be described as a cross between the works of a [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/), [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/), and [Sebastián Ramírez](https://tiangolo.com/) as I work on building AI applications in Python.

### PyCon India
Working on a talk proposal for PyCon India - if you have some interesting ideas or a topic which you would like to hear about, do share it my way.

### Readings
- Learned about `torch.scatter`, `np.put_along_axis` functions from numpy and pytorch
- Reading the books Obstacle is the Way by Ryan Holiday, Think Again by Adam Grant

### Open Source
- Working on [this](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/125601) pull request in PyTorch on adding support for `torch.put_along_dim`
