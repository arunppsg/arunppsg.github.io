# Time Value of Money

Money loses value over time. I built a calculator to calculate how much value money loses over time - check it out [here](https://arunppsg.in/money-value/).
# Memorizing Thirukkurals

This is something which I wanted to do since childhood - learn kurals and memorize them.
Now that I am powered with Anki, I am adding kurals as Anki flashcards and reading them.

# Go Lang

Learning Go language.

# Standardizing Insurance for Products

I bought a new phone and the salesman asked me to buy accidental insurance but I ignored, despite past evidence of dropping phone.
I also avoided putting in a temper glass or covers for the phone as it will not give good aesthetics.
On the second week of new phone, I dropped the phone and the screen shattered. Now, the cost to repair it is ~40% of the phone.
Two main lessons from this:
- Anything which can break will eventually break.
- Spend 10-20% additional cost to protect the item on top of purchase cost of the item

# Recent Epiphany

- Perfection is a myth.
