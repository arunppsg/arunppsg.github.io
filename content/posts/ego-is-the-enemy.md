What is ego?
It is something which says I am an entrepreneur because I struck our on my own.
It is what which says I am going to win because I am currently leading.
It says I am important/special because I think I should be/I am chosen.
It says I am rich because I made some money.
Privately thinking you're better than others is still pride.

Little temporary success spoils you.
Ego cries for self-importance.
It blinds you from doing real-work.
It makes you a block head.

How to stay away from ego?
Choose humbleness.
Stay a student.
Be disciplined.

Ego stops you from doing great work or useful work.

Where does thirukkural comes in here?

After work, there is work.

Wrestle with the void.

If you don't like to work, face the void rather than making the void go away.

Pick up good habits each day and leave out old factors - like Genghis Khan.
Genghis Khan was adaptable, the army learned new things and internalized the knowledge.
That's the way forward. To do: Read J. Weatherford's Genghis Khan and Making of the Modern World.

Ego begs for importance. How to overcome this feeling. What are 
It wants you to make you feel as the someone big.
In reality, we are small.

Meditate on the immensity.
Think on how small you are.
See the size of the universe.
Earth is a pale blue dot.
Remeber that we don't matter.

So many great people have walked the land before you and are going to walk the same land after you.
Everything is going to be the same - but only different people.

The self-pride which you get after a little success kills further successes.
It makes you beg for importance.

Talking dissapates energy.
We talk to reassure ourself, make us feel good.
Doing great work requires wrestling with the void, overcoming the fear and temptations.

Why is canvas strategy required?

## Failure and ego
When we face failure, ego tells us that we do not deserve this failure.
Ego tells us we deserve better.
We fail a lot and ego stops us from going through the failure.
Life throws challenges at us when everything seems to be going good.

You need a purpose to persist through the failure. 
## Dead time and alive time.
Every moment, in the adversity, you can choose to have it as an alive time - the time when you are learning, stretching and growing or you can choose to have it as dead time - the time spent on complaining like misfortune is due to fate, I don't deserve this etc.
Whatever maybe the situation, make it as an alive time.

## Effort is enough
At work, we might not get the deserved recognition or the credits.

Ego asks you to fight with your employee.
It asks you to take revenge, give a tit-for-tat, like when a coworker delays something, ego says that you too are privileged to delay it.
But that's not how it should be.
The focus should be on the delivery of duty, doing sincere work without looking at recognition or results.

Have a purpose and put your efforts towards it.
The world validates your work, your purpose - they may reject your work or recognize your work.
Your job is only to do the work and keep moving towards the purpose, even if failure comes where ego asks you to stop.
Don't take the acceptance or rejection into your mind.

You might be punished your colleagues mistakes, a of no wrongdoing because the world is unfair.
Ego says `I don't want this. I want _______. I want it my way`.
Take it as a time to reflect on yourself and examine your actions.

Ego syas this isn't worth, this isn't fair, it is somebody else's problem in failure.
Do not get distracted by sense of failure, which the world projects on to you.
Have internal metrics which allows you to progress while everyone on the outside does  not believe in you.
Be anti-fragile.
Don't let stubborness make a bad situation worse.
Accept, be humble and be strong.
