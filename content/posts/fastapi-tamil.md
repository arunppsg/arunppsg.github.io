title = "An abandoned experiment - Translating FastAPI documentation to tamil"
date = 2023-03-07

It started with an ambitious idea - convert Python documentation to tamil.

The reason I wanted to do this project was:
- English is a language barrier for entering into tech by non-native speakers of the language.
I grew up speaking Tamil and one book which accompanied me since when I was 8 years old was Oxford English Mini Dictionary.
I had a hard copy of it and still continue to have it in my desk.

- There were technical terms, like `ephemeral port`, `heuristic` and without knowing the meaning of these words, I was not able to understand the core concept or what ephemeral ports do.
- There are tech tutorials in youtube in native languages but they lack the depth which is required to develop good software.

I thought let's experiment with a smaller project - converting FastAPI documentation to Tamil and so I took on the project in October 2022. I gave myself an agenda of converting first 3 pages of fastapi documentation to tamil by Oct 31, 2022.

The first weekend of October, I went to Thiruvarur district library where I got a dicitonary of english-tamil translations of technical terms and made a copy of important terms, like framework etc. Then, I started docs translation.

Some of the challenges which I faced were:
- Translation required high bandwidth than I expected. 
- Some of the technical terms did not have a good tamil translation.
- The process of typing tamil words in english keypad was very slow. For example, completing a single sentence often took about 5 mins for me.

I realised that I will not able to allocate the required bandwidth for translating the docs due to other commitments and I moved the project to my todo list. Meanwhile, if you are interested in translation, here are some helpers:
- Some of the translation words for which I made a digitical copy are available [here](../../assets/files/en-ta.txt).
- Checkout the discussion [here](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/9198) in fastapi forums.
- A pull request of docs translation requires two reviewers. If you make a contribution, feel free to tag me and I could review it. My github handle is [gusty1g](https://github.com/gusty1g).
