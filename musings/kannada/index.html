  Kannada Gottilla to Svalpa Kannada Gottu
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-06-08</strong></p>
<p>I moved to Bengaluru in July 2023.
I learnt my first word - <code>hesaru</code> when someone asked me my name.
With a great enthusiasm, I picked the book Fluent Forever by Gabriel Wyner to learn the language.
Then, procrastination kicked in.</p>
<p>After not knowing the language for about a year, in Aug 2024, I resolved to learn Kannada.
Why now?
For <code>survival</code>.
I was not able to speak with the locals, share words with them except for <code>kannada gottilla</code>.
Neither was it easy to navigate life, like shifting of houses.
Without the language, I can live but I can't thrive in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>How I learnt it?</p>
<ol>
<li>Used <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> flashcards for remembering the language.</li>
<li>This YouTube playlist - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzMePlfekxw&amp;list=PLOb5Wwt1GhOm5wWhnVT-eP5wTIgkdpDz9">Kannada Kaagunitha</a> is clean, clear and super good for learning the sounds of the language.
I went through the playlist, learnt the alphabets, their sounds and added it to my Anki deck.</li>
<li>The Fluent Forever book has 625 frequent words for which I created
Anki cards using Google Translate and <a href="https://alar.ink/">Alar - V. Krishna's Kannada English Dictionary</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Sentenced were created using Google Translate and the words
meaning were found by mapping to Alar and then they were added to the deck.</li>
</ol>
<p>The flash cards created contains Tamil words and alphabets at some places.
But it can customised to any other language.
How can you customise the deck for you?
Sounds (alphabets) in Kannada language overlap with sounds in other Indian languages.
For each note in the deck, if the word is in Tamil/English, use the above resources
(Kannada Kaagunitha YouTube playlist, Google Translate and Alar)
to change it to your familiar language.</p>
<p>How to learn faster?
Add more images to the deck - evolution has made our brain to store images
better than abstract facts.
Personalizing the deck helps in better retention of the words in memory by
making more connections for the word with other items in memory and also
ensures better retrieval of information.
For instance, put in your pet dogs photo to remember the Kannada word for the dog.
Read the <a href="http://amazon.in/Fluent-Forever-Learn-Language-Forget/dp/0385348118">Fluent Forever book</a> or the <a href="https://sive.rs/book/FluentForever">notes of it by Derek Sivers</a> for more pointers on learning faster.</p>
<p>The Anki deck is made public <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/91076173">here</a>.
In the coming months, I will add more sentences as I learn more words.
A v2 of the deck can be expected by year end.</p>
<p>My level of language and vocabulary currently is of a 7 year old's.
But I hope to learn more words, improve my vocabulary, write a few phrases on my own and
get fluent by the end of this year.</p>

<p>The story of Alar is in itself an interesting one worth a read. You can read it <a href="https://zerodha.tech/blog/alar-the-making-of-an-open-source-dictionary/">here</a>.</p>
