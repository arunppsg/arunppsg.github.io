  Learning Kurals
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-08-23</strong></p>
<p>I woke up feeling uneasy to breathe.
My dad picked me up from bed, took me too doctor who gave me an injection for my wheezing to subsidize.
The doctor, the one who gave me breathe, ended the appointment with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural">Kural</a>.</p>
<p>The above was ~2006.
That was the time when I started having high regard for the book - the one's who know
Kurals can give breathe life into others.</p>
<p>Forward to 2016, my professor Dr. R Nadarajan used to quote from the Kurals<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.
Seeing them in school text books, public places and transport, as words from
eminent persons increased the fascination for the book in me.</p>
<p>This blog written today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Numerous self-help books, time management guidelines come and go.
But Kurals has endured the test of time.
And what has endured 2000 years can be expected to endure another 2000 years.</p>
<p>The timelessness, ubiquity and deep value in the concise 7 word of the 1330 couplets attracted me to it.
I find the school of philosophy by Kurals to be kind, gentle, loving of humankind,
and more attentive to common good of humanity by advocating self-virtue.
Moreover, it does not ask one to adorn saffron robe or to renounce worldly life and
live the life of an ascetic to attain inner peace or salvation.</p>
<p>I tried memorizing Kurals multiple times - during school, the COVID-19 pandemic etc.
But each time I failed spectacularly.
Why memorize Kurals?
The world is chaotic, with too much noise and distractions, creating a false sense of urgency,
fear, desire, anger, hatred and other psychological triggers.
There also comes everyday questions - what's the right mindset?
To do or not to do? How to handle problems and situations?
I needed a guiding light. And for me, that was Kurals.
But to live by them, I need to have them embedded inside me.
And memorization does that - as I go through every situation, every day, the embedded Kurals in me
provides me a set of rules and guidelines to lead a good life.</p>
<p>Moving on to 2024, I came across <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> and Spaced Repetition System from <a href="https://sive.rs/srs">Derek Sivers</a>.
That was an Aha! moment for me.
Knowledge fades and eventually disappears unless you keep it refreshed.
Anki helps me exactly with that.
I created Anki cards for about 500 of the 1330 Kurals.
Now, every day, I refresh the Kurals in my memory and learn new Kurals using the Anki flashcards.</p>
<p>I don't say that I live by them but each day, each moment, I strive for it.
As Kural 358 says, moving away from the delusion of birth and the realisation of perfection is knowledge.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>பிறப்பென்னும் பேதைமை நீங்கச் சிறப்பென்னும்
</span><span>செம்பொருள் காண்பது அறிவு.
</span><span>Kural 358
</span></code></pre>
<p>And I hope that I move towards realizing perfection.</p>
