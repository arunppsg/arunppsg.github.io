  An abandoned experiment - Translating FastAPI documentation to tamil
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-03-07</strong></p>
<p>It started with an ambitious idea - translate Python documentation to tamil.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to do this project was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>English is a language barrier for entering into tech by non-native speakers of the language.
I grew up speaking Tamil and one book which accompanied me since I was 8 years old was Oxford English Mini Dictionary.
I had a hard copy of it and still continue to have it in my desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were technical terms, like <code>ephemeral port</code>, <code>heuristic</code> and without knowing the meaning of these words, I was not able to understand the core concept or what ephemeral ports do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are tech tutorials in YouTube in native languages but they lack the depth which is required to develop good software.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I thought let's experiment with a smaller project - converting FastAPI documentation to Tamil and so I took on the project in October 2022. I gave myself an agenda of converting first 3 pages of fastapi documentation to tamil by Oct 31, 2022.</p>
<p>The first weekend of October, I went to the district library where I got a dicitonary of english-tamil translations of technical terms and made a copy of important terms, like framework etc. Then, I started docs translation.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges which I faced were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation required high bandwidth than I expected.</li>
<li>Some of the technical terms did not have a good tamil translation.</li>
<li>The process of typing tamil words in english keypad was very slow. For example, completing a single sentence often took about 5 mins for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realised that I will not able to allocate the required bandwidth for translating the docs due to other commitments and I moved the project to my todo list. Meanwhile, if you are interested in translation, here are some helpers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the translation words for which I made a digital copy are available <a href="../../assets/files/en-ta.txt">here</a>.</li>
<li>Checkout the discussion <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/discussions/9198">here</a> in fastapi forums.</li>
<li>A pull request of docs translation requires two reviewers. If you make a contribution, feel free to tag me and I could review it. My Github handle is <a href="https://github.com/arunppsg">arunppsg</a>.</li>
</ul>
