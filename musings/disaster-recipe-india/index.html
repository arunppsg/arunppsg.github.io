  Rant: Five Step Recipe for Long Term Disaster in India
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-02-11</strong></p>
<p>Five step recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the attention span of children so that they can't do any useful work.</li>
<li>Don't preach nor follow moral books like Thirukkural and Ramayana, instead use them as a tool for promoting communal imbalance.</li>
<li>Pollute air, water and every other natural resource, so that children don't get a healthy environment to grow.</li>
<li>Don't develop public schools, let them rot.</li>
<li>Make jugaad solutions for critical long-term problems, so that no problem gets truly fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do they matter?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Declining attention span - thanks to social media, attention span of children and people are reducing.
This reduces their learning capacity - to solve a hard math problem or to write a essay,
you need to focus on the subject for long duration of time.
This will create a generation of incapable people who can't do any useful
work for themselves, the society and the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When there is a lack of morals in people, violence, hatred, jealousy and all forms of vices in the population increases.
The lack of moral emanates as honking drivers and garbage spawned in the roads, loudspeakers disturbing people, damages to public properties etc.
In a society where a person is not at peace, peace and <em>tolerant</em> will not exist in the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The raising level of pollution will affect the development of children.
And you can't be healthy in a sick society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a well-functioning public school system, we can't create quality men to run the country.
Nor the lives of poor will improve.
We see this as lot of young people ending up as gig-workers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common sense says that short-term solutions to long-term problems aggravates the problem more.
Again, take the example of Indian roads - it is common to see digging newly laid roads to place an underground pipe multiple times for water connection, drainage etc.
The harder but long-term solution is developing master plan for the city and developing infrastructure by forecasting future demands.</p>
<p>Take climate change - hard problem which needs a collective strategy in multiple fronts - people moving to ecofriendly ways, government working in hand with people to increase forest cover and promoting sustainable solutions.
But part-solutions encouraging electric vehicles without incentives to adopt them nor market infrastructure to use them don't work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank You India .. oops Bharat for bringing out this post from me.</p>
