  On Real Estate Investments
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2024-05-28</strong></p>
<p>People who park money in land, push prices of home up by creating more demand for properties.
When NRIs buy properties which they are never going to use, it inflates the price even higher, making it unaffordable for the locals - the people who really need the properties.</p>
<p>A home is a dream for many. 
By pushing the prices of home up, it eats into the dream of others.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the many who can't buy home in cities buy agricultural land converted into real estate.
Now, we need to replace the agricultural land for food supplies. 
Where do we find the additional land for crops? By cutting forests, killing the homes of animals and birds.</p>
